"3.5 STARS  If you are desperate need for a hat - run to this store!  They have all kinds for men and women, ranging in different sizes.  From casual to fancy to hey I'm going to the Kentucky Derby, you'll find it here.  Staff seem to really know their stuff and there is even a small area where they sell feathers so you can add them to your hat!  I did overhear one person who came in because the had re-done her hat (I guess it was stretched out or needed re-fitting so I assume if you bought your hat from here and it needs some care they can help you out!)  The only thing is, while I loved a lot of the hats, the prices were a bit too steep for me.  Especially if I needed one for just an occasion.  But if you wear hat on a regular basis then I would spend the money to get the quality that is here  The sign at the front says it has been in business since 1895 and the inside has that dark library in a mansion kinda room feel to it which I love.  I almost expected to see people walking around with cigars for some strange reason",neutral

"I miss the Courtyard Cafe!! The remodel and the name change is nice but the cafe is much smaller. We do miss the old Courtyard Cafe and its menu especially the Southwestern Salad.The  menu which is now smaller, no where near as appealing and the prices have increased quite a bit. This is no longer a place to get a quick cheap meal. Soda is now $3.50 and we had to ask for a refill! Chicken salad on rye was good (but now  $12.99 lol!), potato salad had to much vinegar. Cream of chicken soup ($3.99 cup)was VERY bland and needed lots of salt and pepper plus it was OVERLOADED with  carrots, celery and huge chunks of chicken(?!?weird for a cream soup) open faced turkey ($12.99)was just okay. The stuffing was mushy, watery and the over powering sage flavor was just to much. When we left the long line to get in makes me wonder why they decreased the size of this place.",neutral

"Ok, so I went here with my Mom and a group of people for her birthday.  The drinks were good, I'm under 21 so I had a raspberry iced tea, which was good, and everyone that had wine or beer thought it was a great selection.  For an appetizer I tried the chicken wings, which were huge (bigger than my fist) and very delicious, being only $5 on the happy hour menu, it was a great deal. It came with 3 wings.  For my entree I tried the chile rubbed mejor steak.  It was $20, and the disappointment was bigger than the steak.  The steak was smaller than the chicken wings were, with even less flavor.  I honestly don't even know how they removed as much flavor as they possibly could from their steak.  The size of the steak alone made me want to leave upon looking at it, but the hopes of flavor kept me going, only to end up wanting to cry in the spiciest mashed potatoes I have ever had.    In the end, I wish I had only had more of the chicken wings.  The drinks, wings, and service were the only things that kept me from getting too upset.  At the time.  This happened a few weeks ago and I wasn't going to write a review, but I've had this eating at me and pissing me off at random times.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.  If you're a steak fan, I wouldn't go here.  The chicken wings were the only things on the menu that looked appetizing to me.",neutral

"Is there a secret code for guys to take you on a first date here?? I've been taken here for 3 different first dates- like they'll come pick me up and just go to turtle jack's with no warning. So it's literally deja vu over and over again. Meh, I didn't mind.  Turtle jacks has a dark and muskoka atmosphere; it's a nice, cozy environment and I can definitely see why all the ladies men choose to take their lady friends here. The service at turtle jack's is pretty consistent- never AMAZING but never rude. I remember once my date for the night and I stayed behind way after last call, and the waiters all put up the chairs (a sign meaning ""..hey.. you can go whenever now.."") but they never rushed us out.   The food is ok.. nothing to brag about but nothing gross. I've had their chicken fingers here, which was meh (I prefer mcdonald's nuggets to be honest). I've also had their greek salad with chicken on top. Also meh, nothing memorable.   In the end, all I can say is this restaurant is 'A-ok'",neutral

"We ended up at Sammy's Famous Corned Beef after trying to get pho at Tram's Kitchen and forgetting it was a Monday (Tram's is closed on Mondays).  The bright neon lights flashing FAMOUS across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.  I ordered the Sammy's Special, which is 5 ounces of corned beef topped with sauerkraut or cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing on your choice of rye.  I went with sauerkraut and rye bread.  I also got a side of potato salad b/c it costs a buck and I was kinda worried I'd still be a little hungry after the sandwich.  The sandwich was alright; the corned beef wasn't as salty as I expected and sliced really thin.  I would've liked my bread toasted, the heat of the meat and sauerkraut warmed up the bread from the inside.  Toasted bread might have also held up to the wetness of the sauerkraut and Russian dressing; the bread was extremely soggy by my last bite.  One of my companions said their pastrami was underwhelming and to stick with corned beef (he had two sandwiches).  The potato salad was pretty standard with a dijon mustard base.    They also have a bar in the dining section of the place, but since it was around 2:30 PM in the afternoon I decided not to get a beer at that time.  Overall I was satisfied with my meal and I'd probably drop by again if I was in the area, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get their sandwich.",neutral

"My friend and I had been looking for a nice gym to go to after work and did some looking around...Decided to go with Planet Fitness but accidentally signed up at the wrong location. We stopped in and talked with Jennifer, she told us we would have to cancel from the other location, which was unfortunately on 40th street. We did so and I tried to go back a few days later. Apparently you don't need Moloch more than a 2nd grade education to work here. Idiots. There was a girl up front who was not only rude, but a liar. One thing that is disgustingly unprofessional is when an employee flat out lies to a customer's face. I told her the situation and she just glared at me. I told her I just needed my membership redone. She said, ""yeah well I can't do this. I can't wave your fee. Only a manager can set all this up."" I was pretty frustrated at this point and told her that it was my 3rd trip there. Quickly she changed it up on me, ""well, I'll do it but I need your account and routing numbers"". I'm sorry, but are you kidding? I called her out on her lie and walked out. About a week later I called and Jennifer answered and told me that we could just stop on in and she would take care of everything. Met my friend there and within 15 minutes, everything was done. Extremely professional and polite. Can't wait to see her around!",neutral

The very last time I was in Vegas, the line was pretty short & the bf & I only had to wait about 25 minutes. I figured it's now or never; the lines were never going to be this short again, so we paid our $16 per person & shared an indoor ride with another couple.  Despite being very cheesy and the most touristy thing you could possibly do in Vegas, it turned out to be a really fun, romantic ride. Our gondola driver guy sang one silly song & one romantic song & instructed me & the bf to kiss. It was really cute. I'm glad I experienced riding in a gondola because I don't know when I will ever make it out to Venice, but I don't think I will be taking that ride again.

"This place was just okay for my fiance and I. It was a nice place and have heard great things, so we finally gave it a try. I understand dim lighting but it was SUPER dark in the restaurant, little too much for me, but might be fine for others. He ordered the chicken, I ordered the burger. We also had the mac n cheese appetizer.  First, the mac and cheese was good, but it was ruined by putting salsa on top of it? That was a bit strange and wasn't a good mix in my opinion.  Second, his chicken was pretty bland and dry. It was just okay. For the money we were paying for that, we were definitely expecting something with a bigger portion and a lot better tasting! I ordered the burger medium well, it came out rare. I don't mind pink, but that was just too pink. I think he might have misheard me for ""medium rare"" instead of ""well"" which I can TOTALLY see and understand, especially with music playing. Unfortunately gave it back and did not order anything else or another one because it was pretty late and we wanted to go out. The drinks were good, nothing to write home about, but again these were EXPENSIVE.  Probably wont be back, nothing to memorable about this place except the high bill ;). Definitely a nice place, but just not for us.",neutral

The drinks are on the pricey side but it's a nice place with a large outdoor patio with a ton of seating and fire pits and a nice indoor with large windows so it feels a little like you're outdoors. The DJ really sucked while I was there because it wasn't real dance music and he played all the awful overplayed songs that make people change the radio station (a whole lot of black eyed peas and pitbull). The last hour he shifted into rap/hip hop which was much better but kind of late into the night. The bar was understaffed for the party and it took forever to get a drink...however I think under normal circumstances the Stone Rose would be a really nice place to come for nice cocktails & relaxing outside.",neutral

You can taste the freshness in the food that you won't find at one of those stereotypical chinese fast food eateries. The portion sizes were generous too and a family meal is more than enough food for a family of 5, or perhaps even 6. That being said, the taste was only decent. The fried rice was flavorful and rich. The egg drop soup was as expected. The orange chicken is tasty and familiar, but brings nothing new to the table. The kung pao chicken had lots of crunchy vegetables but I have had better. The crab rangoons weren't good at all, but don't take my word for it because I've never liked those things. The spring rolls were ok but I've had better at random hole in the wall thai restaurants. The bottom line is that this place, while worthy of my future business, still cannot beat Pick up Stix in terms of quality and flavor.

While the salsa was tasty it wasn't worth the price.  If that is the way they want to serve it they should give you a side of tortilla chips instead of saltine packages.  My husband ordered a Club.  It was good and the bread was delicious.  Nice atmosphere. We ate outside and enjoyed the lovely AZ weather.",neutral

"For ages I kept hearing my friends rave about this place, and I jumped at the opportunity to go (after all, who doesn't love hot breakfast?). I've been three times now, and I still don't understand the hype.  The service is consistently good, and although this place is always busy, I've never had to wait for a seat and I've never felt like that place was too crowded. It can get a little noisy though, making it difficult to talk without feeling like you're shouting.  I typically get scrambled eggs with bacon, home fries, and rye toast with coffee. It's just okay. My biggest issue is with the home fries. Hands down, these are the worst home fries I've ever had. They are always cold and hard; they definitely have not been cooked enough, I may as well have eaten a raw potato. On my first visit I thought maybe this was a fluke and gave them another chance, but it's happened every single time I've eaten there. Hugely disappointing, as the home fries are always my favourite part of going out for breakfast. The eggs, bacon, and toast are fine, but nothing is good enough to make up for those home fries. There are much better places to go for a hot breakfast.",neutral

The second time I ordered a Ribeye and it was burnt. Had to drive back to get it replaced. The manager did compensate for the inconvenience however which was a plus. Food is pretty good otherwise.,neutral
"It's been several months since I went to Sweets Raku, and I've been contemplating on how to review them. Do I follow the crowd and rate them high because it's almost expected of a place like this? Or do I find fun along with the faults?   First, it's an experimental experience. Desserts crafted here can be found nowhere else. They focus on creating sweets with laboratory precision with artistic style. Different flavors, colors and textures stimulate the senses.   My personal experience & observations:   Inside is bright, clean and modern. A glass wine cellar holding dozens of dessert wine serves as a wall by the entrance, guiding customers along the wall, where people just wait their turn. As you inch closer, there's a menu on the wall for you to study. Along the wall are cookies, macarons and other bite sized goodies for sale. Dozens of small tea canisters line the wall for an artistic display.   Tables are slow to be cleared for the waiting customers. Some sit there dirty for 10 min before anyone comes to clean it.  When we were next to be seated, the entire bar seating section of 8 was open, until a staff broke a glass on one end. They didn't seat anyone for more than 10 minutes because they took their sweet time.    Once seated, our orders were taken fairly quickly.  We asked for water, then we were told they automatically serve it to everyone.  Then I wondered why people who were seated after us got their water, and desserts before we did.  There's no order.   Each person is required to order a minimum of $12.  With a price of $15. for a dessert creation, it wasn't hard to achieve.  There's also a dessert set for $18., which includes a main dessert and a seasonal, which is basically a small scoop of sorbet that usually costs $5.   We ordered one set of the Carib and mango sorbet w mint jelly ($18), and one Mars ($15) The sorbet was hard to share, because it's about the size of one spoonful, topped with mint flavored jelly that really didn't go with the mango.  The Carib was served in a large glass, covered with a white choc lid. While served, they poured hot mango sauce over it to melt the lid into onto the other ingredients. The contrast in flavors and textures does get mixed up, but it worked.  Though I don't feel it's worth $15.     The Mars was served in a shiny red sphere. Vibrant color and perfectly round. FlambΓ© brandy is then poured over to melt the sphere, revealing the inside concoction.  Though pretty and highly photogenic for social media, the flavor did not work, and was ruined by the brandy. Also not worth $15.    The service by the entire staff was not impressive whatsoever.  Only one Japanese girl thy seated us managed to crack a small accidental smile.  A tall guy who assisted the pastry chefs had no facial expression nor personality.  The chefs themselves seemed very much in work mode and not personable at all to any of the patrons who undoubtedly came to see their creations in amazement.  While we were being served, a very brief description was announced and they did it bother to wait for any questions or photo ops. Luckily I observed how they were with others so I had my camera ready.    In my opinion, if a business will charge this price point, make us all wait standing in line, and they seem to take their sweet time cleaning tables, at least give us an experience of decent, friendly service and not act like his is some type of swanky, snobby Hollywood elitist hangout.    I may be back just out of curiosity, but not in any hurry, and know also not to expect any friendliness.  The 3 Stars is solely for creativity and the modern interior. I am not rating them higher based on the hype, or because everyone else raves about this place. Speed and level of service is def a 2.    See my photos & videos for menu, descriptions, interior and desserts.",neutral

"I really wanted to love you, L'Etoile, but the service and food was just ok.  We did the tasting menu with wine pairings.  It started with a basket of cold bread (at these prices, some warm fresh bread should be part of the deal).  Speaking of bread, the table next to us waited so long for their bread that they had to ask for some, to which the server replied ""we try to time these things accordingly.""  Dude, the people are hungry!  Just give them the bread.  We also got served someone else's tea course before our food came out, much to our confusion, and no one acknowledged the gaff, so we just sipped it like like, ""thanks for the chamomile...?""  Less then stellar culinary moments included a protein and melon dish with such large chunks of melon that it overpowered the whole thing (I can't even recall what the protein was - fish?  Foie gras? Therein lies the problem, it just wasn't memorable).  We eagerly anticipated the steak course which was served somewhat blandly with potatoes, swimming in corn gravy (it was begging for some acidity or brightness) and the meat was cooked just a little too long for that nice of a cut. Highlights were the dessert (a scrumptious custard) and the wonderful and quirky sommelier, Steven.  He was a breath of fresh air and we loved everything that was paired with the meal.  That being said, I wouldn't go back the next time we're in Madison.",neutral

Second time I've been here. First time with the boys. Like any Saturday night it was extremely busy. We had a party of 8 and were seated within 30 minutes. The service was slow but very accommodating. They brought out the kids meals quickly but faltered on the adult's meals. We ended up leaving and having our meals packed to go because the kids were done 1.5 hours in. But I have to give credit to management. They took our entrees off the final bill. I was not expecting that whatsoever.   You have to try their lobster crab dip appetizer. It's really good.   I had their Brie Burger. Very good combination of fixings and Brie cheese.

I was disappointed with the fries though, but the sweet potato fries my friend got was fried very nicely. I also got the cookies and cream milkshake, and found it ok. Not worth 4+ dollars in my opinion. I also tried my friend's nutella peanut milkshake and found it waaayy too thick and heavy, so not really worth the hype in the milkshake department. Although the burger was good, it wasn't exceptional enough for me to be like, ""wow, I must take my friends here."" Considering that I paid $18 for a burger combo and large milkshake, I expected something truly exceptional and I found this place fell short.

There must have been 12 pieces of CA roll per order.  They tasted ok, just average.  The tempura was way overdone with a thick batter, and just looking at its oiliness made me queasy.

The prices, in my opinion, are inflated, as are most of these chain auto places-and they always suggest a million other things that your car should get, but that you don't necessarily need. They were there for me in a pinch and I am grateful! We had only the necessary repairs done, without being pushed for anything further. As another reviewer posted, the promised times are way off. It took quite a few calls and an entire day to finally get my car done. I've had tires and oil changes done here too, and they are always courteous.

"This place is hit and miss depending on what you order.  Hip vibe and good happy hour menu.  If i'm in the neighborhood, I'd go again, but it's not worth it to drive here.  Service was pretty good, servers were attentive enough.  What I had: Pretzel Fondue Pretzel balls can be a little more chewy and softer, but the molten cheese for dipping is quite fun.    Port Salut Semi-soft, creamy, and delicious with their baguette.  Jamon Iberico Acorn fed, free=-range, black hoof pig....so they say...It was delicious and thin, but were sliced with a machine!!  They weren't hand carved by an experienced jam on handler...but then again, this is Phoenix.  What do I expect?  Grilled Cheese Sliders These were ""slider"" sized or personal size grilled cheese that were not so mini.  Crispy outside, fluffy and cheesy inside.  From their happy hour menu.  Korean Shrimp & Chicken Stick I don't know what's ""Korean"" about this, but the marinade was spicy.  The veggies were also very spicy and good.  The chicken could've been more juicy, but the overall dish was pretty good.  Smoked Salmon Bruschetta My fav item.  With pickled pink onions, tomato, capers, and olive oil.  Tangy, smokey, crispy.  Addictive!  36-Hour Pork Ribs Full rack of baby back ribs that are slow cooked for 36 hours and basted with sweet and spicy jalapeno and molasses sauce.  Served with fries and yummy coleslaws!  The sauce was very tasty, but there were some spots on the rib that were too salty for some reason.  Then there were other parts that weren't salty.  Perhaps the chef literally threw a handful of salt on the ribs!?",neutral

Atmosphere is exceptional. Love the way the Guild puts their places together. The decor makes you feel comfortable. Even the bathrooms are a nice theme.  Lamb burger was nice - not ""gamey"". Appreciated the ketchup. #Salad was #fresh & the dressing was well done. Simple & standard.   Wine list was ok. Not the place for people looking for wine specifically.  Moderately priced. Lamb burger $18.   To make it a better experience for me, I will need to see the food being slightly different, albeit I had a very limited experience with the food choice. Will need to try other things on the menu to change my opinion. We may revisit.  Service was good. MaΓ®tre D was nice. Chatted about the nice navy blue dress ""uniform"" which looks professional.

"Was it my leather wallet that upset the staff? You could tell that Urban Herbivore takes Veganism seriously even prior to you entering the place. There is a crossed-off fur sign (Canada Goose Jackets beware!) on the door that we thought was a symbol of their devotion to the cause.  However, there isn't as much devotion to the food. We had the Moroccan Stew with Quinoa and while the portion was huge the taste was somewhat bland and lacking.  Have you had a dish that you simply stopped eating because it was way too boring? Yes... this stew did not exactly set our taste buds to vegan-disco party.  And although it's a big portion the prices ($10) were not comparable with the value you are getting out of it, and for that price you could try out other Vegan food places in Kensington Market e.g. Hibiscus' Vegan Savoury Buckwheat Crepe.",neutral
"My husband and I were driving around near our house looking for a place to have breakfast early on a Sunday morning. We chanced upon Postino as one of the few places open before 10am on Sun.  I'm glad we found the place.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with salad and tomatoes and my husband had the ciabatta french toast.  Both of our dishes were fantastic, though portions were smallish but overall decent value for the price/quality.  Our coffee and mimosa were great too--mimosa way more champagne than OJ as it should be. My complaint here was with the service.  I didn't realize that the restaurant's specialty is bruschetta and that they also serve the full menu on Sunday morning; nor did I realize that if you want bread with your breakfast you need to order bruschetta.  Our waiter never said a thing.  He seemed more interested in ""looking the part"" and I had to ask that he take our order at one point after we'd both been seated more than 10 minutes at a non-busy time. To top it all off, when we asked for the check, I was handed a bill padded with an extra drink and breakfast item--really, really BAD. I do see a return trip here, however, as the food is really, really well prepared from very fresh-tasting ingredients.  But WATCH THE BILL HERE, KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU ORDER.",neutral

"I've wanted to try this place for breakfast since I saw it on Man V Food but somehow it took me years to finally get here. I just don't get up early enough on weekends to get out for breakfast too often. Anyway, if you're tired of the same old breakfast when you do get out, you need to check out this place. The menu is intimidating with loads of interesting choices but it almost seems as if you can't go wrong. Everything looked impressive as it was served to other tables. It took me quite some time to decide what I wanted to eat as everything sounded great but I wasn't disappointed with my choice. The only downfall is it's a bit pricey for breakfast but it is semi touristy and you do get A LOT of food. I felt more full than I normally do walking out of a breakfast buffet. I'll definitely have to try this place again soon as there are some other things I definitely want to try.",neutral

"Today, I was at Bell Rd. Toyota (20th Ave & Bell), having my vehicle serviced. After checking in my car, I went into the customer service lounge. As I am walking in I witnessed two of the dealership staff, a blue shirted service staff person and an office staff member in a dress shirt and tie, pillaging a vending machine. They were shaking and banging it so hard it sounded like there was demolitions taking place. The noise even startled to younger children in the lounge. Once these dealership staff were done one came out and announced... ""Anyone want chips?"" He had three or four bags to share.   I understand being frustrated with a vending machine but this is perhaps a little extreme. One could say they are only a couple few bags of chips but I want to ask...  If the staff is this causal about taking chips from the vending machine how are they about servicing our cars? I already don't trust dealerships now I am doubly concerned. Ultimately their ethical standards are in question.",neutral

We came into an empty restaurant to a confused hostess who did not know where to seat us.  Once we were seated, we ordered our meals. When the same two appetizers came (dips and sauces), we had one piece of bread for the two appetizers. Every other table had two breads for two appetizers. We kindly asked the waitress... three times in the span of 30 minutes. No acknowledgement. It should not be that difficult to get a piece of bread. Waitress could not care less about our table. While taking our order she spoke over us to the table across, which was pretty rude.

One of the highlights is the range of choice in the all-you-can-eat menu. They have sushis with brown rice, with all kind of tempuras, with all kind of fish, all kind of meat (yes meat). They even have a sushi-pizza and sweet sushis. OK for you Torontonian that may seem normal but for a frenchman it's rice-christmas! Our sushis contain salmon or tuna, seeweed, sometimes, and avocado if the place is really wild. Other plus, the stuff is good! I read that another reviewer can easily come up with 10 sushis place better than this one. I'd love to try them. As I said I am not a sushi connaisseur, but these are definitively the best I had in Toronto. Downsides now. First the service. Not the fact that they are not smiling. I'm coming from Paris, I kind of like that. But, first, because they try to make you drink tons of tea or water so that the rice expands in your stomach and you leave with a full belly that will seems empty one hour later, and, second, because they put a really nasty pressure on you so that you leave quickly your table. Not the usual 'no rush' that means exactly the contrary but insistant stare-down that tells you that if you don't exit right now the chef is going to come and use you as raw material for his brand new type of sushi.

They are charcoal grilled from what I understand, but I can't taste it. The meat tastes pretty much like a standard fast-food burger. Not bad, mind you, but not great. That said, their fries and onion rings were good. Next time I want to try the tri-tip sandwich and others in my house want to try the albacore tuna. Others have raved about those.   Of course, this is a fast food place (but it is not fast, everything is made to order), so the decor reflects that. No points off for that since it is exactly what you would expect. Service was good.   In all, a decent place and a good addition to the neighborhood. Maybe I can bump it up a star after I try the tri-tip.",neutral

(to be honest...i didn't want a burger so late in the evening).  i thought it was odd that the ladies bathroom had only one toilet and a sink...it made for lots of waiting.    on the positive: the 10 dollar entry included a goody bag and in my lovely goody bag:  8 oz grace foaming and shower cream! astara skincare samples, coupon for massage from space, 20 percent off urban seven for lunch or dinner, and a wine stopper.  1 martini and 1 house wine also part of that 10 dollar entry fee.  the martini was average in my opinion. i can make a better martini at home.   i digged the restaurant side much better than the bar. they had some cool drums playing and our server anthony was great. he made sure we had everything we needed. he was attentive and personable.  so i would probably return to the restaurant and give them a second try with my 20 percent coupon. i enjoyed the cool vibe.",neutral

"This is my 3rd time here and either I was really drunk from the unlimited alcohol the last 2 times that I didn't remember all the bad qualities or that the selection has gone down hill. I'm not saying it was terrible, it's definitely better quality than most of the strip but not as good as I remember a couple of years ago.   Right now they have their holiday pricing for lunch which is $45 which is like double the normal price. $60 for unlimited Bloody Mary, Mimosas, Champagne, and Beer. I decided to opt out this time. The wait wasn't long (30 minutes at most) due to it being slow season. Now for the selection, they have a breakfast, meats, Asian, and desserts section. I was really disappointed because I didn't understand what justified the holiday pricing. No ham, turkey, festive food or anything. Plus there was barely any seafood. I was expecting crab legs, cocktail shrimp, oysters, etc. They only had cooked mussels (tiny and cold), cooked shrimp in an Asian sauce, 3 sushi rolls (nothing great). I did enjoy the fresh salmon at the breakfast bar. What I found interesting they had a oxtail pho bar. The other food was fine but nothing to rave about. The service was excellent. Our waiter checked up on us multiple times and very timely with our refills.   Would I go back again probably but only if it's back at regular pice.",neutral
"The service is very slow do to having only one waiter wait on 6 or so tables. The sushi is very good tho so I guess it's worth the wait. We waited about an hour for a table and when we finally got a table we waited another 15 minutes just to order our drinks and food since we looked at the menu outside. Appetizers came around 25 minutes in and the sushi started coming around an hour later. In all the food was great we had grab ragoons and all sorts of sushi from the charlotte roll, philly roll, spicy salmon, wasabi roll and so on we also had the family chicken with veggies and brown rice which was the last thing served to us and 5 minutes later we got the check which was not very pleasing. They took a very long time getting our receipts back which was about 10 minutes. It was a good place for food but if you're in a hurry I don't recommend it.",neutral

"There's a lot of hate for the service at America, but I didn't have any issues. Everyone was quite nice and considerate. On decor - the restaurant is on the 31st floor of the Trump Tower, but the view isn't as nice as other roof top restaurants like Canoe or the Roof Lounge at the Park Hyatt. They dim the lights at night to a point where you feel like you're in a night club and there's a DJ in the back who puts out some good tunes. This was alright as we were heading to the club afterwards, but I can imagine some people taking issue with this.   We had a large group so we were able to sample a lot of the food on the menu. The food is hit and miss, but mostly miss. The appetizers and the dessert weren't that good. Some of the entrees, however, were quite nice. The highlights: - Whole Roasted Dover Sole (MP, ~$70 for us): you don't often find dover sole on restaurant menus so this was quite a treat. The fish was cooked and de-boned very well. Probably the best dish of the night. Note: they only serve this on Fridays.  - Tomahawk Rib Steak for Two ($150): if you start with high quality meat, it's hard to screw it up. Nonetheless, this tomahawk was good - cooked to the right temperature, tender and flavourful.  - Mac & Cheese side ($9): not an entree, but this side got quite a bit of attention at the table. It's more cheese than mac, so if you love cheesy mac & cheese, get this.  - Complimentary cornbread: not an entree, but this was so good we had to re-order it 3 or 4 times. They're fresh out of the oven and have a perfect amount of jalapenos for spice.   Of all the restaurants that I have called ""pricey"", this one probably sits near the top. It's not just the dollar amount, but the value of the food/beverages that you get for it. At America, it was way over the top. I would probably only return if I'm not paying for it or during Winterlicious/Summerlicious.",neutral

I really used to like this place.  Dark dive bar that served food late night and was always cool on a hot Phoenix night.  It still is all of that but the food has gone down hill and there are other options in Downtown Phoenix that serve good Irish Pub food and / or are open late night.  Bar - 4 stars.  Great bartenders that pour stiff drinks and are generally on top of things.  The place does get a little crowded and the bar is a little long.  If there is only one bartender behind the bar he or she can miss you if you are on the other end.  5 - star scotch / whiskey selection.  Food - 3 stars.  I used to really like the Rueben and the Chicken Pot Pie.  Unfortunately both have declined.  They don't grill the rye bread in butter anymore I think they just toast it. The Chicken Pot pie crust is not good.  The fish and chips are good and the fish sandwich is good too.  I still come here for the drinks and the cool dive bar air conditioning but the food used to be a lot better.,neutral

"My brother took me to this restaurant a few years ago, and for some reason I remembered it as being so amazing that since then I have been telling him I wanted to go back.  I finally made it back during my last visit, and I'm sad to say it's just not as good as I remembered.   This is definitely a fun place to go if you are wanting the true Korean BBQ experience.  I thought the lunch price for the all-you-can-eat was a little steep with it being $23 per person, but there was a good variety of meats to choose from.  My brother was disappointed that the ribs were not a part of the lunch menu for all-you-can-eat, but they are for the dinner.  We also were confused on whether this price included tea, as he thought it did but it did not list this anywhere.    We enjoyed the spicy chicken, ribeye, and sirloin.  All the meats were really good also the ribeye was very fatty.    Service could have been better.  We asked for tea at the end of the meal which never came.  We gave it about 15 minutes before deciding to get up and leave.  Other than that and the price, I really enjoyed my experience at Lee's.",neutral

But not only were we disappointed in this years meal, we have noticed that the quality and quantity of the food in this restaurant has gone down hill tremendously.  Smaller amounts and higher prices. Service is also not the same, like it used to be. It's just not the same anymore here. I used to love going here, but now I will pass and next year I will make my own Thanksgiving dinner at home, and it will probably be a lot cheaper.",neutral

"Finally got to try this new ayce sushi restaurant. I had to call one week in advance to reserve a table. Tonight I had reserved a table at 7pm. My friends and I arrived on time but we still had to wait about 15mins to be seated. Line up was crazy as usual, tons of people packed in the front door. Inside decor is pretty nice and cozy. The seats against the walls have pillows which adds a nice touch.   We had heard and read reviews that the torched and pressed sushi is really good. But to me it was just alright. The torched beef sushi and maki rolls were pretty good though. Also the pork belly and lamb skewers were yummy. Sashimi was fresh and good. They have a large selection of items and some that other ayce restaurants don't have. I would say the food is decent though, not that great. Zucchini tempura was way too soggy. Seaweed salad too dry. Spicy salmon sushi was meh. And they put too much sauce on their special maki rolls. The other cooked foods were ok, just like any other ayce restaurant.   I really enjoyed the desserts here. They have a big selection and unique items but I was too full to try them all. My favorite is the mango slush, vanilla creme brulee and the cheesecake. Kinda sad they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the red bean ice cream wasn't even available.  Service was surprisingly very good other than being seated 15mins late for a reserved table. Food came out pretty quick and didn't miss any items. Our waiter was super nice and made sure we were ok and got all our items. We got to stay 2.5 hours as there was another reservation after us.   Would I come back again? Maybe. But definitely not my first choice especially since I had to book one week ahead.",neutral

Stick with those as you can't go wrong with those. I mix peri peri sauce, ketchup and chili powder together and eat my chicken and fries with that. Try it!   The value is what brings Nandos down though. The portion is small and is somewhat on the expensive side considering what you pay for (close to $12 for a quarter chicken and one side). That being said, if something tastes good I have no problems paying a bit more.   If you're not sharing, pay a bit more and order the 1/4 breast and wing! The 1/4 thigh is so small it's laughable. Also, don't assume you have to buy a bottled beverage, ask for a glass of water!   Personally I don't tip when I eat here. There is hardly any service so why should you? Hmmm.",neutral

"After a meh visit at the Scottsdale Quarter location, we received a coupon for BOGO free through their rewards app. We decided to visit this location and give it a try since we were in the area. When we walked in, the first thing we noticed was how packed it was. Did everyone come for the coupon? There was probably around 20 or more people waiting to get their ice cream.   The workers did yell out to please be patient a few times as they are working as fast as they could. We sat down and waited... And waited... Then we stood and waited... and waited...the whole time watching.  I understand that the ice cream is made to order, but the process was not efficient at all. There were times that no ice cream was being made/churned. The workers were all working hard, but if there is a promo going on, you would think that they would staff it better?  So, after 45 minutes, we finally got our ice cream.  Thankfully it was made well/correctly and tasted good.     Overall, after 2 sub par visits (here and the Scottsdale Quarter) and 2 good visits (Scottsdale Waterfront and Uptown), they are batting at .500... Which isn't very good for an ice cream shop.  I'm not sure how often we will make it a point to go since it is kinda pricey and a 50-50 chance of it being a good experience",neutral

"In protest of the lousy service that I've experienced at the Go For Tea in Scarborough, I decided to drive a bit further to their Richmond Hill location.  I do not mind driving the distance if it means that I'm less irritated on my way home about the horrible food experience.  This location is much bigger, although parking is not as plentiful as the Scarborough counterpart and you have to compete with patrons who share the lot with a plaza that is also home to a Baton Rouge.    I ended up scoring a sweet parking spot that I am surprised was not reserved as a Handicap spot because of its proximity to the front entrance, but I shall shut up and count my blessings!  We were promptly seated.  It appears that the employees hired at this location have a working knowledge on their English.  About 2 minutes after we were seated, our server came by to take our order.  I ordered a Honey Green Tea to nurse my undying cough, and Boyfriend ordered the Coffee Milk Tea.    We lingered for about another hour longer after we finished our respective drinks, and I was surprised when a server brought us glasses of water.    For once, I can say that I have found a bubble tea establishment that has quality service worth mentioning.    They also do not set a password on their wi-fi which means that you can start surfing the moment you walk in the door.  The Scarborough location requires a password... I could crack a Scarborough joke, but I really don't think I need to add to the list of ever-growing Scarborough jokes that already exist.",neutral

"Overall this place does a decent job.  That being said, it is super clear that pepper is their favorite ingredient.  I ordered a pork chop for dinner and it comes with a pepper sauce (thankfully on the side).  I chose sides of mashed potatoes and buttered corn.  The corn had so much pepper in it you could almost not see the yellow.  It barely tasted like corn at all and I couldn't eat much of it.  Our server was exceptionally friendly although really slow to bring things like butter or water refills out.  She did bring fresh rolls because she took so long to bring the requested regular butter.  Apparently they were having a server meeting in the kitchen and you can't leave the meeting even if you have a guest requesting something.  I don't think that is a good practice at all - your guest requests should come before a staff meeting.  All the servers had to do a line dance of sorts during dinner also and it was pretty clear none of them were jazzed about having to do it.  Seemed kinda hokey - something more appropriate for a bar in Mexico than a restaurant in Phoenix.  But back to the food, my pork chop was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes were very good also.  Only thing I would advise is lay off the pepper. And if your buttered corn is actually peppered corn, it should be advertised as such.",neutral

I was in and out in about 15 minutes.  I'd definitely go back.",neutral
"I'm slightly surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I would actually give it a 3.5 stars. This is a place I used to dine frequently. Mainly because they were conveniently located at Santa Fe Station which is down the street to me.  I agree their service can be pretty bad sometimes, especially more recently. Maybe it might be because they will be closing soon as the Grand Cafe will be reopening in it's place...  The food and the service used to be better but it really has gone downhill. Though I still enjoy their bakery. And their seasonal menu is still interesting. I must say I do enjoy their sweet potato fries.  Their croissant sandwich is also yummy.   Try to stay away from chicken or broccoli here, I have had pieces that were bitter. eww. But you can't go wrong with their desserts, they are yummy! From the cookies to seasonal pies, etc. I went there around 4pm to have breakfast one day (it is served 24 hours but you have to ask for the breakfast menu. But the servers have no clue have to serve breakfast and what it comes with). I was so excited to find they had red velvet pancakes! But it was such a fail. The flavor and texcture of the pancakes were not good. And because it wasn't a breakfast server, she didn't know about a whipped cream cheese that should've came with it. Overall just not good...  When Coco's is gone, I might miss it. Mainly for their bakery.  This review is long overdue and I can't even remember the details. Overall, though, I do like this place for a quick bite and some sweets when I happen to be at Santa Fe Station, but would not go out of my way to dine here.",neutral

Waiter  was very attentive.  We needed more time once we placed the order it took about 40 minutes  to get our food . Worse they brought the last order 10 minutes  later with no apologies.  . I had their three pieces  of chicken  with two sides.  Red beans with rice and fried  okra. .there was not much h beans.  Mostly rice . The okra was swimming in oil. I did like the corn bread.  Chicken was crunchy.  But overcooked and no seasoning. Sorry but Popeye is a better. Choice.  The waitress  disappeared  on us for 15 minutes.  . Food looked fresh but it was marginal,neutral

DQ... it's an oldie but goodie!  On a recent visit with girlfriends, I did see that DQ now offers all kinds of food items as well.  Maybe they've done this for years, but I haven't really ever paid attention as I've gone in for my ice cream cone, blizzard, or slushie, and left.  On this particular visit, I stood in a longer line and actually looked at the menu.  I'm not so sure I'd trust this location or any other DQ for chicken fingers, hot dog, hamburger, salad, etc...   That being said, go here for dessert.  The service is fine, but not super friendly.

"So I have couple of different issues with WHASN but first let me say that aside from feeling like the doctors are literally shooing you out the door during your appointment I do feel MOST of the doctors are warm and knowledgeable.   1st issue- last year during my pregnancy at the beginning of the year I went from an insured patient to a cash payment patient, I paid everything I owed at the time of the visits. I paid $2k in cash for my upcoming delivery. But 6 weeks before I gave birth I obtained insurance -and was told by MULTIPLE office staff that with the type of insurance I had that I would be getting a FULL refund for the delivery fee 8 weeks after my son was born. 8 weeks passes by and mind you I was adamant about keeping in contact with the billing department to get updates on the status of my refund as I was told by office staff to do so. So 8 weeks passes and still no refund and every time I call I get the run around. I eventually have to resort to getting firm and directly asking for phone numbers and emails of office managers to resolve this issue to find out why my refund is taking so long, because no one knew anything. So cut to the chase 3 months after my son is born I finally get told a check would be cut that day and I could pick it up. I go to pick it up and it is for $1000. How is this possible? I paid EVERYTHING in cash up until my insurance took over which covered everything. So how am I not getting my full $2k back?? The lady working in billing instead of going over everything with me hands me a stack of my billing papers and tells me I am welcome to go home and check against my records. Excuse me? I'm not a medical billing professional and the paperwork she gave me looks like a foreign language to me. So there goes $1000 dollars thanks WHASN! Mind you this is not the first billing discrepancy I've had. When I was a cash payment client I was told my account had a balance during one of my next visits which was NOT true, and luckily I had the receipt from my last visit in my wallet to prove the mess-up was on their end. Someone in the office had done the coding wrong. So I have no doubt they still owe me $1000.   2nd issue- I cannot tell you how many times they have forgotten to send my prescriptions to my pharmacy, how many times I have called the nurses stations to try and get prescriptions changed where I DO NOT get a call back and I have even had a referral that never got sent that was for a skin cancer scare.  I feel as if WHASN has too many patients that staff cannot accommodate their needs promptly and properly. Also when you are pregnant, especially as a first time mother you would like to feel like you can speak with your doctor without feeling like you are being rushed out the door.   The only reason I have stayed with WHASN is because the doctors have now done 2 surgeries on me (ectopic pregnancy tube removal and cesarean section) and the they are fantastic as far as medical needs are concerned. But the treatment and the feeling rushed like cattle is starting to not feel worth it. So honestly I'm going to start researching a different doctors office to go to.",neutral

"I was at Cava once before and had a very memorable meal. This time around, I was quite disappointed. Overall the meal here was not a bad one. But it wasn't very good either. We didn't get a good value for our money, and the only flavour for the food was salt, salt and more salt. Cava is said to be one of the better tapas restaurants in town, and over the years it has received good reviews. It may be that they are resting on their laurels. But, they better start picking up their game if they want to maintain their clientele base.  ""SUPERGILDA""  - Price: $5 - Rating: 2/5 - The dish came highly recommended by the waitress, only to disappoint. - Consists of a single crouton covered with a small slice of sardine, but ruined with the addition of a toothpick skewering a couple of olives and an anchovy. It was a very 1980's presentation and the flavour was salt on top of salt on top of more salt.  CROQUETA OF JAMΓ“N WITH CAPER-SULTANA SAUCE - Price: $4 - Rating: 1/5 - Thumb-sized croquet tasted OK, but was very little value for your hard-earned money.  CHICKEN LIVER & FOIE GRAS MOUSSE WITH TOASTED HOUSE-MADE BREAD AND ACCOMPANIIMENTS - Price: $13 - Rating: 4/5 - Very tasty, silky smooth mousse. - Not a very large portion.  JAMON SERRANO - Price: $17 - Rating: 4/5 - Nice ham, descent portion  PAPAS FRITAS  - Price: $7.50 - Rating: 5/5 - Amazing fries!  These fries alone salvaged the meal!  EGGPLANT WITH QUESO FRESCO, BONITO, & TOMATILLO SAUCE - Price: $12 - Rating: 3/5 - Nice dish, the bonito flakes add a nice accent.  PAELLA - Price: $65 - Rating: 2/5 - The chicken was nice, but not plentiful (only 2 quarter legs) - The clams were dry - The shrimp was nice - There was very little rice and it was  VERY salty, almost un-edible. - Overall, a salty unsatisfying EXPENSIVE dish.  TAJINE OF LAMB WITH QUINOA, AND ROASTED OKRA - Price: $23 - Rating: 1/5 - There were only small traces of lamb meat, which was dry and salty - The okra was extra slimy - no effort to reduce the slime - The dish was not presented in a tajine, which is kind of the main point.  I ordered a Tempranillo which they ran out of. They highly recommended an alternative at a higher price. But it turns out it was a blend with only 1/3 Tempranillo and wasn't very good.  The service was overall good.",neutral

"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I don't know what else you can ask for at a bar on the Strip.  Rock climbing wall, beer pong, and a full bar.  It's not gonna blow you away with the quality of the drinks, the selection, or the prices, but overall it's a nice spot if you're looking for somewhere to drink.  They have a solid Happy Hour and they have  an outside area to strip people watch if the weather is right.  It has a similar vibe to any of the other chain bars, but the ideal location on this side of the strip knocks it up a peg.  There are definitely better places to go if you're looking for a quality drink or an upscale clientele.  But if you just want a college environment similar to a Tilted Kilt or the like, then PBR is a great substitute.",neutral

"Tutto Pasta is a pretty decent Italian restaurant. As I am quite the sucker for Italian, I've been here a fair share of times.   My favorite thing about Tutto Pasta is that the portions are huge. To me, the more, the merrier! I love the tutto pasta dish, the lasagna, and both the meat and vegetarian calzones. Their pizzas are okay, but aren't as filling, so I wouldn't recommend getting pizza at Tutto Pasta (after all, there's an Ian's and a Pizza Di Roma on the same street).  Going in large groups isn't always the best idea. But service isn't bad, and the free bread is always a good gig.",neutral

"The best reason to go to Trader Vic's is the drinks.  Rum makes an appearance in most of them and they're all kitschy and delicious.  Some are more alcohol-tasting than others, and the mai tais are wonderful. The coconut-looking glasses are a hoot.  As for the food, my four companions and I all agreed that it was overpriced for the quality.  I had the fried rice, which was good, but not really any better than what you'd get from a good Chinese restaurant. For the $20 I paid for it, I certainly expected that the shrimp would be of a bigger size than a quarter.  It was disappointing.  One of my companions ordered the salmon, which she said was good, but not necessarily any better than what she could have grilled herself.  We got the dessert sampler, as well.  The idea of 'a little of everything' is a great one, and more restaurants should do it.  However, the creme brulee didn't have that nicely fired crust on the top that it should have.  If  you're staying at The Valley Ho and want a quick stumble back to your room after too many Suffering Bastards, I'd recommend it.  Otherwise, I'm sure there are better restaurants in Scottsdale.  Go to Vic's for the drinks and dinner elsewhere.",neutral

"A couple of weeks ago, I braved the fortress of Chandler Fashion Center in search of an engagement ring fit to rest on my girlfriend's finger.  Specifically, I took a trip to Bailey, Banks, & Biddle on her mother's recommendation and, knowing their reputation for service, embarked with confidence.  I was told to speak with Jeff, their manager, because he would treat me very well and perhaps even cut me a deal.  Jeff was nice enough, but I mean nice enough in a car salesman kind of way.  Peep these gems:  ""Well, you know we're owned by Zales so we only get the highest quality diamonds!""  I know you buy your diamonds from the same places as every other jeweler.  ""I must say, for your age you have excellent credit.  Just excellent.  We can go bigger if you want!""  I know I have good credit.  I also know you said that so you could get me to spend $2500 beyond my budget.  I almost did.  In the end, I did get a very nice ring that my now-fiance loves.  Jeff apparently wasn't able to negotiate on the price of the ring, but promised more flexibility with the wedding bands.

I appreciated the fact that he showed me the used one because I am still very new to gold and do not want to spend a fortune on nicer clubs, but I also am past beginner sets.  The problem I have with this place is that there were signs stating the clothing was buy one, get another 50% off.  I picked up a few items and went to pay, but the cashier told me that the sale only applied to a few brands, not the brand I selected.  I did not argue because I had shopped on Amazon and new that even with the sale price I thought I was getting, Amazon was a little cheaper, I would just have to wait for delivery.  She said that the signs and the system were not always in sync.  This place is great if you know what you want, just do your shopping first and make sure you are comfortable with the price.",neutral

Certain items weren't ready but we were able to substitute for the sides that weren't quite ready.  We both ordered the short ribs and since the mashed potatoes weren't ready we were able to get the risotto or potatoes au gratin and a choice of broccolini or seasonal vegetables.  We choose the broccolini and risotto with the short ribs.  All was delivered fairly soon and looked appetizing.  The flavor was decent but the texture of the short ribs wasn't fork tender like I expected.  All the food was only luke warm not hot.  I prefer my food hot but didn't want to send it back.

In I walked, and the first thing I asked them is if they sold juk (Chinese porridge)?  Lucky for me this was our savoir! I was able to get the juk that I wanted for my loved one, it was rather expensive, but when you need it, you need it!  This place offered seven types of juk -  1. Frog Leg Porridge  -  $19.00 for Large 2. Seafood Porridge - $17.00 for Large 3. Fish Porridge - $17.00 for Large 4. Fisherman Porridge - $17.00 for Large 5. Pork Porridge - $12.00 for Large 6.

This attraction is right next to the Phoenix Zoo so you will see a lot of people from that. The space itself is really small so it's tough to get a nice picture without other people in it. If you want to avoid those people, go early because if all you want is a nice picture, it shouldn't take long.  It's about a 5 minute walk from where we parked. Where we parked, it's not a big parking lot but there's a ton of parking a little further out where the zoo parking is. I wouldn't even consider it a hike.  In terms of a view, it's not the best view because from where we were looking out, you're just looking at a parking lot. There are many other tourist attractions in the area that have a much nicer view.  There's really not much else and I'd say if you're in the area, stop by just to say you've been, but don't go out of your way to go here.",neutral

I enjoyed the people watching very much today. My favorite was the man with a red bamboo fan, fanning himself at the table. It WAS a fairly warm day.  Or was it the combination of the heat and eating pho?  Does he always carry a fan with him or was it for pho?  Regardless, it matched his outfit so bravo to him for accessorizing well.   Despite my suspicion, I was very happy with what I ordered. Bun with chicken, shrimp skewers and egg roll. Everyone 's food looked amazing though.

"The location is great - located on Unionville Main Street, it's a good Mexican food option for those that frequent the area or are visiting for the first time. The restaurant is small but cozy and they have a small patio perfect for warmer days. When my friend and I went on a Friday for lunch, the place was empty - we were the only customers until a party of four entered towards the end of our meal. All tortilla entrees come with Mexican fried rice, refried beans, and pico de gallo. We ordered steak quesadillas ($11.50 excl. tax): a flour tortilla with feta cheese and chipotle sauce or sour cream and steak enchiladas ($13.50 excl. tax) with mild sauce: three rolled tortillas with feta and sour cream. My friend loved the steak quesadillas and would give them a 4/5. I thought the enchiladas were just okay - a 2.5 or 3/5 at best. The enchiladas' mild sauce was too sour in my opinion and because the enchiladas are covered with a generous amount of it (the amount is a good thing, the flavour of the salsa not so much), I didn't find myself enjoying the dish too much. Overall, Planeta Mexico is a good Mexican food place. The service is super friendly and accommodating. I'd go again if I was craving Mexican and happened to be on Main Street but it's not a place I'd seek out.",neutral

"I visited Union during the holidays w my husband and sister & brother-in-law for lunch. I ordered the gnocchi w pork & beef ragu. My husband ordered the burger; my sister the polenta & bro-in-law the salmon. We all really enjoyed our food & wine. The portions are big, so a very filling lunch. There are lighter (salad/soup) options too.  The main reason I gave Union 3-stars and not 4 is that they need to work on their interior temperature control. There was no barrier between the front door and the seating area except a flimsy curtain that was constantly being opened. So with the -20C outside it made for a uncomfortably frigid meal experience. Folks at the front bar were fully bundled up in coats while drinking. If they are trying to go for the Ice Hotel experience they hit the nail on the head. My advice spend the money and get a real double door installed.",neutral

"Got the higher priced ticket and sat in the front row at the very end.  This revue features a band that consists of a drummer and a keyboard/sax player.  That's it.  They did a great job considering there was only two of them.  The band has two backup singers, and the woman singer occasionally sits in on piano.  The highlight of the show were the male singers, especially when they sang together as the Four Tops.   I thought the real star of the show was the guy singing the Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson songs.  He seems very charismatic with a great smile.  Frankly, I was puzzled by the line up of talent.  The songs didn't really come close to comprehensively covering the genre of soul music.  The songs seemed to match the singers' strength instead.  For example, there was a middle aged woman who looked a bit like Dionne Warwick and sang only Dionne Warwick songs and nothing else.    Finally, the show featured four female dancers and two of them handled backing vocals too.  I guess they add to the act if you like Vegas dance routines.    The room is pretty small but wide, so getting a higher priced ticket like we did wasn't that necessary.  A few rows back would have been just fine.    Bottom line:  This show isn't nearly as good as Hitzville at the V Theater outside of Planet Hollywood.  But still fun.",neutral

The first glass - the actual glass itself - had been quite dusty. She completely ignored that - no comment, no apology. In fact, she treated us and the situation with disdain. The food didn't leave a bad taste in our mouths - that server did. Fortunately she only served the wine. Our food server was great.",neutral

"I have had mixed opinions on this restaurant for a number of reasons.   The good:  The country fried steak and eggs are delicious! The portion is huge and the piece of country fried steak keeps it's crunchy composure when covered in the gravy.   Omelets- I haven't eaten a bad omelet here. The options are endless and all get served with nice fluffy eggs and those scrumptious fried potatoes!   The service- Is always top notch. Drinks are always refilled and you never have to wait 30 minutes for a check.   The not-so-good:  Eggs Benedict- I once ordered this entree and the piece of ham had a huge piece of cartilage in it. It spanned across half of the piece of ham. It was so unappetizing that it took me almost 6 months to return here to eat.   The long wait time- If you are unfortunate enough to get here after 9am on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to wait. I have waited in excess of 30 minutes for a table of 2. I attribute the long wait to the lack of non-IHOP breakfast joints in the Centennial Hills area. We need an omelet house over here!",neutral

"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(264/365) ""The Keiki Bowl""  Last time I set foot in this place was when Ric Guerrero was opening up Slidin' Thru Northwest. Braddah's has taken over with their ""Hawaiian Style Chipotle"" concept. The first time I tried Braddah's on Rainbow, I got a loaded burrito with Huli-Huli and Pulehu Steak, but the flavors of the meat got lost in all the toppings and the tortilla lost its chewiness and got solid real quick.  This time I was gonna get a bowl....no tortilla, minimal toppings and Huli-Huli Chicken.  I kept it simple...Huli-Huli, Brown Rice, and Corn. What really bummed me out this time was the tiny size of the TRAY, not a BOWL that Braddah's uses, and the Keiki(kid) portion sizes given. Chicken tasted like Chipotle, but smaller pieces, not Huli-Huli Chicken. and my already small container was only two thirds full! I was already regretting not going to the other places who do sell bowls at similar prices around the area(Chipotle, Zaba's, T-Mad, etc.) and their bowls do fill me up for the same price or a tad bit more.  Yeah, the bark is bomb, but something that's easily duplicated at home. If you're coming in for a meal, I would suggest dining in, they probably give you more. ALOHA!!!

It is located in Paris near the buffet. You can actually watch them make the crepes. In some sort of a way, it is almost like art. The lady with the long pony tail did not make it like art. I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing, but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them, that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu. You have sweet and savory options. I had the monte cristo.I would of liked more cheese that was melted, less turkey and ham, and a more flavorful bechemel sauce.

"Took the wife here for breakfast on Mother's Day. It was early enough that the wait was only 15 minutes or so. Took a while, about 10 minutes to place our order with the server. She did greet us and let us know she would be with us shortly as the family next to us had sat down first. I know that Mothers Day is the busiest day of the year for restaurants so I was patient and understanding.   The menu had a good variety of options and was laid out and visually appealing. The ambience of the restaurant was very quaint, classy and comfortable. The server was friendly and took our order right away since we were ready by then and didn't want to take a chance on the next go around. They were obviously under staffed.   The food presentation was excellent, but the food quality and flavor is why I gave them 3 stars. The steak was chewy and tough, the scrambled eggs were not fluffy, hash browns undercooked etc. I really wanted to love this place, but the food was the crescendo that fell flat.   I will give them another try for sure as they are very close to home. I also understand today of all days could have been an anomaly due to high volume business.

"This review is only for the bar/lounge area.  I haven't stayed at the hotel, so I can't say what the rooms/prices/service is like.  I went to the lounge here only because my most favorite bartender in the world started working here, and I would follow him anywhere.    It's very different from the usual places I frequent.  First of all, the lounge area is very small and within throwing distance of the front desk, the restaurant seating area, and even some of the hotel rooms.  I like my lounges a little more secluded.  Second, the two or three times I've been, the DJ has been playing some hip-hop/80s/techno music.  It's almost like they want the place to have a club-y vibe, while I like my music a little more chill.  The decor could be described as bright and gleaming white.  Rumor seems like a loud, bright, and exciting place.  Reminds me of Miami or something, and I'm sure people love that kind of environment.  It's just not quite my cup of tea.",neutral
Great place for a laugh but falls a bit short on food. While attending a show we decided to get a couple of drinks (they have a 2 drink minimum) and an appetizer which we ended getting the bruschetta which was to soggy but good in flavor. We also ended getting their drink of the night which included a free souvenir glass and a voucher for 2 free tickets for a following show. The drink was not to par with taste and strengh. The venue is great and the service was also good. Will be back and order some more food just to give it another chance.,neutral

"I came to Steamers once before for a job, and I told myself if I ever needed to watch a game this is where I'm coming. This place is right around the corner from my house and well, lets say they have a lot of TV's. It's a sports pub, I didn't expect less. So I came here to watch the Knicks play because of an Asian American player Jeremy Lin play and I didn't receive the game at home.  I ate the Philly Cheese Steak. The waiter came and asked me if I wanted tomatoes and lettuce, and I did however when they came back they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce and they brought it out on a plate instead. The tomatoes were fine, but the lettuce looked a little old. I drank a couple of beers and watched the game. The place had some pretty good 90's music and a good amount of country.   My roommate who went with me ordered a burger and said it was juicy and well cooked, so I can't really comment on what his thoughts were. (However, he does have the credentials because he's a student at Johnson and Wales and works in a kitchen) After we ate our entree, we ordered the nacho supreme. It wasn't bad. the lettuce still wasn't that fresh, but the portion size was okay. At 10 every weekend they have karaoke night.  Overall, if I come back here, I would just order a beer watch the game (as they had so many TV's just ask what you want to watch and they'll get your own TV) and then go home. Maybe get some nachos as it's not expensive at all. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about with the prices were expensive.

They also do that fine-dining thing where you have a high price-to-potions ratio.

"Love the industrial vibe of the place. Love the servers, some of the nicest I've ever come across. Love the menu, as everything is mouthwatering, or close to it.  Food comes out lightning fast, like you're still wondering if you ordered the right stuff, and bam! there it is, leaving you to decide by looking at it. The flavors are also spot on. Even the televisions nail it (at least when we were there), with some Asian game shows, along the lines of MXC, subtitles and everything. Nice.  What isn't quite right is the execution of the dishes.  - Ramen mac & cheese: Flavor was good while warm, but unfortunately after a minute or two, that cheese turns into a government cheese glop, which is not attractive at all. The crispy pork skins added nice texture, until dissolving into the glop.  - Wings (specifically soy garlic, but I suspect on others): The flavor was again spot on, but the breading was so thick, it was tough to get at the meat below. I think this was a breading and not some alien, radioactive Troma-movie like super-thick skin, but I really don't know. Our son loved them, however.  - Pork belly: great flavor, but totally mixed textures. The meat was great. The fatty portions, in bits, was good. The cracklins were often too tough to eat due to fear of breaking a tooth. Next time, the pulled pork would probably make a better choice.  - Buns: Related to above, trying to make sandwiches with pork belly (and other items) was a good choice, and with pulled pork, would probably be an excellent decision.  - Sweet potato swirl: Again, amazing flavor, but one of the oddest things I've ever eaten. If you can get any to your mouth, it dissolves in cloudy goodness, but getting it there is a challenge. Bonus: If you save it, take it home and chill it in the fridge, it becomes a lot easier to eat (though you still get the stickiness of the sauce on your fingers).  - Potato swirl on a stick: Also great flavors, but a little unwieldy, not quite as bad as the sweet potato however. At this point, we were just slowing down. Had as an appetizer, this would have probably been better.  End result: Amazing flavors, even presentation is great. But eating some things wasn't the easiest, and definitely messy. Think fajitas, but worse. Probably not a first date place. And wetnaps would do wonders.",neutral

"Our Wednesday evening experience was a mixed bag. Nice place, good service at the bar, but the food was disappointing. It wasn't the execution either. My backyard burger windsor style was hot and cooked properly. What was missing was savory flavor. Everything was sweet with no balance. The burger itself did not taste to be seasoned and all the accoutrements were sweet including the bun. My wife got the crab cake BLT and it was assembled and cooked fine, but it is just a bad design. It comes on a huge chewy hoagie roll that drowns out any crab or bacon flavor and is virtually impossible for humans to put in their mouths. The chopped kale salad was way too tough to eat. A quick blanche of the kale followed by an ice bath would improve this a great deal. The bartender was knowledgeable and fun. The food was awkward. Really should be 2.5 stars instead of three.",neutral

"First you have to ring a buzzer to be let in.  Then when they open the door they confirm your ""membership"".  Located in a shady shopping center next to Hot Bodies Spa which I'm guessing is an erotic massage parlor or some creepy crap and Hush Club which is a swinger sex bar.  According to the management do to the debauchery next door they won't allow men inside the store.   Many years ago I got into an argument with someone claiming he was the owner about discriminatory practices while his two doberman pincers jumped all over me.  They aren't licensed as a private club yet they operate as one.     I used to really like the selection of merchandise in years past.  Now they  have 2X the space and use it on things that don't interest me like salon services and dance classes.  I don't know if they have changed ownership or buyers or both.  The selection used to have range.  It was fun.  This last visit I found nothing but dull cookie cutter crap.  It's still a fun store overall.  I have found cute stuff here over the years so I will continue to shop here from time.",neutral

"Comparatively speaking to the bubble tea places located in that area (i.e. Ten Ren's, The Sugar, etc.).  I find that the Green Grotto Room is not bad for its price and its quality.   Firstly, the ambiance is not bad there.  Lots of magazines for the... Asian magazine reader (which, I am not).  However, there's free wi-fi located there, so I guess you can get a lot of work or... MSNing done there.  I had the baked mochi with ice cream and red bean.  Ordered a red bean hot milk tea along with it.   The red bean milk tea actually had red bean in it - which surprised me thoroughly!  Much better than the one that I ordered at The Sugar.  The baked mochi was questionable.. Didn't really taste much mochi - but it was cheaper than most desserts that I have encountered at other places.  A noted drink is the lime yogurt (calpis?) drink.  I was surprised about the tangy taste to it!  Nice place just to chill and have a night out with a few friends to chat.",neutral

"So, this restaurant maybe an old classic but it is new to me.   The menu is traditional breakfast fare. Omelettes, eggs, and of course, pancakes.   I must say the most recent evidence of God on earth is the potato pancake. OMG! they are awesome! with a little sour cream and salt & pepper. Worth waiting in the Saturday morning line.  Customer service is a bit lacking. I went to breakfast alone, as I have no friends...or at least none who will get up in the morning for breakfast. I was banished to the single's booth it was a half booth with a bench a half table and a half wall to face while eating.

"Walking into BT's Burgerjoint, one is immediately greeted by the laid back vibe of a beachfront burger bar. Blue walls adorned with surfboards, naked light bulbs strung from posts, and a mix of Carolina and California beach music drifts from the speakers welcoming customers.  Ordering is made easy by following the directions on the menu boards. Choose an award winning burger, hot dog or chicken, then dress it up with cheese, bacon and toppings of your choice. Several salad options are also available; though the Grilled Chicken Salad proved to be bland, and the Ranch dressing was clearly not housemade.   It is the Hand-Cut Sweet Potato Fries drizzled with Honey Butter that deserve a special mention, though. Warm, tender and salty sweet potato fingers lightly fried and complemented by the sticky sweet Honey Butter induce fried tater euphoria for fry connoisseurs and novices alike. If you are dedicated to their regular hand cut fries, try a Half And Half for the best of both.  Service and wait times are inconsistent at BT's. Long lines at lunch are unacceptable for those on a limited lunch hour or who are attempting to appease the hungry preschool set. However, when the staff isn't slammed, they are attentive and kind.

There's also a salsa bar immediately when you walk in that has several options for all palates.   I was able to get my order in easily enough, but given that it wasn't all that busy, it took a while for my order to come out. There was only one cook on the line and one girl at the counter both taking orders and bringing food out.   The tacos I ordered were the pescado, bistec, and chicken and an horchata to wash it all down with. The bistec was a little bland and dry, which was a bit of a let down. The pescado and chicken tacos were alright, but not much about them stood out in terms of flavor. I will say that these tacos are reasonably priced. The horchata was alright - a touch too sweet but at least it wasn't excessively grainy as some places tend to make it.",neutral

Duck fat fries tasted bad too.    Considering that steaks are their specialty, and even a $10 steak from Quinn's steakhouse tastes better... well, I will not be back.

It was all around good food, but I didn't walk out of there feeling like I had an phenomenal tasting experience for the price.

This was a salad day for me...lots of meeting, so a big meal wasn't in the cards, unless I planned on falling half asleep in a meeting lasting hours and hours.  So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!  I had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...""convicted....no.......never convicted"" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.  The salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out. The place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).

"This place was better than a lot of the reviews on here say. Especially for the price during CES.  We are not party animals, and did not miss having a casino downstairs. We also did not miss the associated resort fee. We got upgraded to a huge 2-floor suite. It had a hot tub, it was clean and good.  Minor gripes:  We were missing the TV remotes but after a call one was delivered promptly. The hot tub only dispensed hot water and it was too hot; we had to walk and get ice. And the closest ice machine was broken. There was no fridge, and that room was enormous so they could have fit one. Housekeeping did enter our room, but all they did as far as we could tell is drain the hot tub.  The blankets were the kind you get at a gross cheap motel. This is a big issue for my man; minus one star for this. Get better blankets, people. Hotel rooms are designed for being in bed, and this should be obvious.   Not a perfect place, but a lot better than many places. Much more satisfying than other places we stayed in the area.",neutral

"I believe in giving the good with the bad when it comes to reviews and I hope that this will help others make a more informed decision.  I should probably give some background to other hotels we've stayed at on The Strip so you have a point of reference:  The MGM Grand, New York New York, The Venetian, Caesar's Palace, and The Luxor.  For the record, I would stay at the Flamingo 100 times before I would go back to the Luxor, but that place was awful.  We've also stayed at a couple of the Hilton Grand Vacations on or very near the strip as well.  I'll start with the good.  If you've ever been to the Las Vegas Strip, you know how awesome The Flamingo is located.  Regardless of the accommodations, you have to appreciate how centrally it is located.  Our experience with the hotel staff (as opposed to the dealers) was overwhelmingly positive.  They didn't do anything extraordinary to set themselves apart but they acted in ways that reflected positively on the hotel.  Now the not-so-great.  First, it should be noted that as of May 2018 the Flamingo appears to be going through a big renovation and when you book you can either book one of those newer rooms or one of the older rooms.  I opted for the latter but on reflection I probably made a poor choice.  Would I have had a different experience in one of the renovated rooms?  I'm not sure, but the Studio King we reserved was underwhelming.  The room size was nice, with a large living area set aside from the bedroom (which had no windows, a big plus).  But the room was beyond sad.  The carpet had not been cleaned in a generation or two and the stains were so bad my wife refused to walk on it barefoot.  The light when you walked in didn't work and was not repaired while we were there.  The room had two telephones, one of which did not work when we arrived but was quickly replaced (like in 10 minutes or so -- very quick).  When you looked at the ventilation you saw what appeared to be decades of caked-on dust and debris -- it was disgusting.  And the bathroom was so small that two people could not fit unless one was taking a shower (which dripped constantly and was prone to leaking more when the water was turned on upstairs).  In all fairness the bedroom was so far away that you could not hear it while you were trying to sleep.  However, the bed was so uncomfortable that we got very little sleep.  I know that bed comfortableness is a personal thing; these beds were FIRM.  If that's your jam, you will probably like these beds.  The sound-proofing of the rooms was also not particularly great.  This is another subjective thing but other hotels on the strip do a better job -- and you'll pay more for them as compared to the Flamingo.  The other underwhelming part of our trip was our universal -- and surprising -- negative experience with the dealers we interacted with.  I'm sure there are good one's there, but we didn't interact with any of them.  These people seemed dead on the inside and clearly were considering the bad decisions that led them to have to work in that casino.  By comparison, we also gambled at Harrah's a couple of doors down and had a very different experience overall, and they're both owned by the same company.    Overall our experience with the hotel was ""meh.""  Our friends wanted to stay here and we had a great time with them but there was nothing about our hotel experience, exclusive of the price, that would make me want to come back.  Looking back at this review maybe I should give two-stars but it was far from the worst hotel experience.  And I'm aware that we could have elected for one of the renovated rooms and I find it hard to judge them harshly when I made an informed decision, even if I regret that decision.",neutral

"This restaurant offers the standard Vietnamese food you would expect if you have ever been to a noodle house. We had the Bun Thit Nuong (Grilled Pork with Vermicelli) and Grilled Pork with Rive. Both dishes tasted as expected. We checked-in on Yelp for 2 free egg rolls and they tasted good, but didn't look good. Judged purely on looks, the rolls were cracked.  One thing about the vermicelli dish is that the egg thing that came with it was severely burnt, so I passed.  Overall, I'm glad we had lunch here because it offered something I was use to.

"On our way home from the White Tank Regional Park, we stopped by Dillon's KC BBQ to pick up food to go. We called to place our order before we left the park, and the food was ready when we arrived.   The woman on the phone was very helpful. We had three people ordering pork ribs with different sauces, sides and drinks. The ribs are prepared with a rub which might be a problem for those on a no/low sodium diet. My dad tried to get the ribs without the rub, and had to forego the ribs entirely because the waitstaff said no ""rub"" was not an option. She was courteous and repeated the overwhelming offerings when we asked. Best yet, she got our order right.   The parking lot is huge! Be sure to park by the restaurant door and not the wildlife zoo door; otherwise you'll have a long walk. It would have been fun to eat here to enjoy the wildlife viewing after dining, but we had our dog and couldn't leave her in the car. Unfortunately they don't allow dogs on the patio either.   The ribs were finger licking good. The corn on the cob is boiled not grilled, so each morsel is very plump and juicy. The steak fries were cold by the time we got home. Definitely not a good item to order to go. My mom was smart and got the baked potato instead. It was wrapped in cellophane so it stayed warm.   I certainly would consider ordering the ribs again. They were tender, and I really enjoyed the ""sweet with heat"" sauce.",neutral

"There's a bit of confusion if you're renting from here and you're not flying in from anywhere.  I was 40mins late to my Pickup time because of a bit of ""running around in circles"".  I'll elaborate more once I get to my main gripe.  So I prepay for my car rental through at third party.  It was confirmed at the desk that my reservation was prepaid.  However, I just look at my credit card info online and it shows two additional pending charges to my credit card.  I know most car rentals have deposits, but the second transaction???  On a prepaid reservation???  The second transaction is almost $100.  If it was half that, I wouldn't be annoyed...but I was never advised of this second charge.  Hopefully the charges both drop off when I return.  Either way, I will be back to update.  I will explain the exact process for renting here for non-flyers, but gimme a little bit absorb these extra charges because I just found out and it has me a bit preoccupied.",neutral

I though that was weird because I could have sworn the sign said the sandwiches came with a side salad or veggies. My boyfriend ordered the cesar salad,  The sandwich was good, lots of bacon and a good size. The chips and salsa were cheap like cafeteria level. Cheap salsa I am pretty sure was Pace.  Bf's salad: Mediocre at best but still edible.  The place needs a little extra attention in its interior and menu ingredients. I would love to have a good cafe close to my house.",neutral

"I can't believe this is a triple A 4 Diamond Resort.    It's nice, it's updated, but the stellar service I expect from that caliber property just wasn't there.  Check-In was a complete ZOO.  The cordoned-off line snaked back and forth, with easily 100 people waiting, and there were 3 check-in agents.  THREE!  That process took over 45 minutes.  Although once I got to the counter, the Agent was friendly, chatty, and pleasant.  I asked for, and received, a comp upgrade to a larger, corner room with a Strip View and two windows.  The room is nicely appointed in contemporary fashion, which I love.  The bed was amazingly comfy, and the white sheets and duvet were clean and fresh-smelling.  Our view looked across at the Venetian from one window, and the other window was over the Pirate's Lagoon, where the free show, ""Sirens of T.I."" is performed multiple times nightly.  This was cool for us, since we are night people, but if you're not (why are you in Vegas?) the show has loud pyrotechnics and fireworks until 11pm.  Unfortunately, one night we were trying to get in a nap between daytime activities and nighttime activities, and the Cable TV was out.  This required four separate visits, in and out, over a 3 hour span, by maintenance and then the cable company.  They were very nice, but it was an inconvenience for someone trying to sneak some sleep into a Vegas Vacation.  Again, though, TI was generous with their comps, and we received a Buffet for Two comp as a result.  (Granted, I had to ask for it, but the front desk manager was forthcoming.)  (Also on that note:  The buffet wasn't even worth the free meal.  It was utterly awful. See my review)  The property is middle-of-the-road for Vegas Strip hotels.  It's not old and run-down like Excalibur or Circus, Circus, but then, it's twice the price.  And it's nowhere as nice as the Wynn or the Bellagio, but it's half the price of those.  So - Quite clearly Average.  (Do watch out for those pesky ""Resort Fees"".  If you book on the phone, they make it seem as if it's a one-time, per person fee.  It's not.  It's $20, PER DAY, PER PERSON.  Typically sneaky, and common at Vegas Hotels.)  Also: THE POOL WAS CLOSED!  We paid a resort fee to hear ""Yeah, but you can drive over to the Trump and use their pool""?  I don't think so.  Inexcusable, T.I.  The restaurants leave MUCH to be desired.  They have a deli, but why would you eat there when the Carnegie is a shuttle-tram ride away at the Mirage?  The buffet, as we've discussed, was disgusting, and the breakfasty-cafe place was ridiculously overpriced, even for the Strip.  ($14 for two eggs? Really, TI?)  Lastly, they have a Pho restaurant.  A Pho restaurant that serves Tripe but calls it Tendon (They are NOT the same thing!) and charges $19 for a bowl that would cost you literally $6 anywhere else in the US.  I'm just thankful I sampled it at the comped buffet rather than paying for it!  So overall, the property's rooms are clean and comfy, and at least they comp freely.  It's centrally located smack-dab in the middle of the Strip.  If you catch a fabulous deal, as we did, ($60 a night including Resort Fee) then it's probably a fine place to catch your Zz's in Vegas.  If you're looking for that signature Four-Diamond service, spend a little more and go to the Bellagio or the Venetian or the Wynn or.... you get the idea.",neutral

Food 3/5. With no rice I had to add my curry dish to my pad THAI. I tried both on their own before that and neither was great, plus way too many peanuts in both.

They only serve homemade corn tortillas which I'm not a huge fan of so its difficult to find alternative options in such a limited menu. However, the tostada looked amazing that my sister got and I would totally smash that next time! The chips and salsa are generous portions for the price and the chips came out warm and crispy! Drinks....wow they are fresh and flavorful. The sangria and bakersfield margarita were to die for. Not too sweet but still full of fruity flavor.  We will come back, gorgeous interior and great location a little way off from the hustle and bustle by west side market. Having indoor/outdoor seating is a plus and our server was friendly!",neutral

The space doesn't have a whole lot of character (brightly lit, a few Mexican souvenirs on the wall, and a TV playing Mexican music videos), but there is a nice patio in the warm weather.  Browsing the menu things looked promising; all sorts of dishes I'd never heard of: flautas, sopes, enfrijoladas, and so on. Definitely a lot more selection than the usual burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. The tasty chips and salsa we were brought reinforced the positive feeling.  We ordered a few vegetarian dishes (big mistake) and everything went down hill from there. The food looked excellent and all the various sauces were great. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have already mentioned, the vegetables were a total disaster. They literally filled our food with frozen peas, corn, and carrots. The rice and beans weren't great either. A total dissappointment.  I want to like this place so I've returned a few times to see if they've improved. No luck.  So, why 3 stars? First, I had a couple meat eating friends with me and they were very positive about their dishes. So, if you order the meat and avoid the frozen veg you should be good. Second, this place has huge potential. If they would just use some fresh vegetables (red peppers please) and get some better refriend beans (it tasted like Old El Paso for christ sakes) they could be a four or five star place.  Pro Tip: Don't order anything vegetarian. Get the bunuelo for dessert: deep fried tortilla with cajeta, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup. Amazing!",neutral

"I'm giving it 3 stars because of our last visit there. My husband and I came in for our first time and had a great experience about 3 weeks ago. Great waitress and service and the pork chili was amazing!!!  BUT the last time that we came in with a couple of friends last Saturday just to have a drink at the bar wasn't so great! We didn't order any food just drinks. We sat down and didn't even get a hello,from the bartender.  A guy ( that looked like maybe a manager) took our drink order so when our drinks came, all we got was ""are you ordering any food"" from our not so friendly girl bartender. My Bloody Mary was super salty and I put it a side as I was not going to drink it. We sat there about 45 minutes so my friends could finish their drinks, still not one word from the bartender. No "" how you doing"" or "" I see your not drinking your drink, everything ok?"" Nothing!! Very unfriendly, grouchy like she didn't want to be there or be bothered by anyone. Very disappointing!!! She really needs an attitude adjustment. I get that people have bad days but really? Not one word to us on how we are doing or a thank you?! The girl had blonde hair and black glasses on, if I come back imfor sure won't be sitting at the bar if she is wokring.",neutral

"The dance floor isn't quite big enough for large parties. It's long and narrow so progressive dances become very problematic. It's more like a bowling ally than a dance floor! This only becomes a problem when medium sized crowds are there -- like 15 couples on the floor simultaneously.   Ambiant is a good place to take small group lessons or privates because in addition to the ballroom floor there are three smaller rooms for private lessons.   The sound system is substandard and gets worse as the size of the party grows.  The owner is a knowledgeable dance instructor and his staff are very capable. He is very enthusiastic about the studio and that counts for a lot when it comes to building a dance community.  The location is odd but once you know where it is, it's easy to find right off the 101.  The Scottsdale area should have a ballroom that can provide for 100+ dancers but Ambiant isn't it.",neutral

"Emeril is the reason I fell in love with food network. After a difficult surgery, bedridden for a month, Emeril carried me through with his shows. I miss seeing him on tv... He used to be the Flay of cooking shows. Anyway... It was a dream come true to finally eat at one of his restaurants.   The crab cake was perfect. The grits sublime. Γ‰touffΓ©e was fair, and the $80 lobster tail was disappointing (chewy).   The decor is boring in the main dining room and walls with their copper twists and cable strung art boxes were terribly dusty. The bar and entrance is charming.   As far as the service, we went in the afternoon and were quite neglected. With 13 people in the room (most of them prepping table settings for the dinner service and some walking back and forth... And three behind us at the water/wait station... ) I was surprised at how long we sat with empty drinks and no one noticing. Regardless of the dust and poor service, the food was great except for the over cooked lobster.   I look forward to visiting New Orleans and trying some more Emeril! Even with $80 chewy lobster, I still adore him and hope one day I get the chance to tell him face to face how he and his shows made a terrible time in my life so much better.  I posted 5 pictures but for some reason only 3 are showing up. I will try to edit this review to include the other pictures.",neutral

"Go during the right weekend and you can find a decent deal here. If it takes you more than an hour to drive here though, I'm not sure the trip would be worth it.  Parking first of all is a huge hassle. Get here more than 1-2 hours after the mall opens on a weekend and GOOD luck. I always come in the morning and by the time it's 1-2PM the parking lot is packed full and drivers are basically stalking people to their cars again.  There are sales that happen during some weekends and that's when the best deals can be found. If you come here and shop at the ""regular outlet prices"", the stuff simply won't be worth it. With an extra discount on top of that however, it may be worthwhile.  A few stores I've had experience with include: -Cole Haan: sometimes has some decent shoes for good price. I'm talking decent leather, fairly good construction, stitched-in insoles, etc. They're no Allen Edmonds, but they do make a good shoe for daily wear. -Asics: the items still tend to be a bit on the pricier side, but if you're looking for Asics gear, it's as good of a deal as you can get -Saucony: their clothing tends to be of lower quality than other brands from what I've seen, and less well thought out. But the prices are also cheaper. Shoes are typically around 30% off retail price (they carry last season's stuff), come during a sale and the prices are sure to be better. -Nike: never seems to go on sale. Prices as they are are better than other Nike factory stores in the GTA, so you might be able to get a decent deal here. But just keep in mind that Nike is what some refer to as a ""Fake outlet"" where the merchandise is often specifically manufactured for the outlet and of lower quality. -Ted Baker: when there's a sale on, you can get a good stuff for quite the price -J Crew: another ""fake outlet"" but the deals can be very good. I once got things for around 70% off! -Bose: just selling refurbished stuff at a discount, nothing special -Icebreaker: they sell nice stuff but even at the outlet prices are still ridiculous  There are also many womens accessories stores like Coach, Kate Spade, etc. that get crazy packed. Lineups all over the place. I guess the deals must be good.  Overall the mall is cleverly priced at a point where it's just about good enough to curtail most people from the hassle of taking a trip down to the States. Can better deals be had south of the Border? Absolutely. But this outlet simply makes it a bit more compelling to avoid that hassle.",neutral

"With powerhouse collaborations to the likes of master chef Susur Lee and 6ix god Drake, one would expect Fring's to be on the same level as these Toronto bred icons. Unfortunately, the restaurant falls quite short of its creators creativity and flavor.  Between 8 people, we were able to order a myriad of items from the menu including ribs, pasta, fries and dessert. The ribs were the best part of the order both flavorful and tender but wasn't anything standout.Β  Similarily, all other dishes were okay but lacked flair or a creative flavor profile which would make it memorable or different from chains like Joey's or Earls restaurant.Β  Perhaps the most disappointing item of the evening were the truffle fries. For over $20 for a small basket of fries, I was expecting a bigger punch of truffle 'umami' than just a very slight scent of truffle. In fact everything was so distinctly lacking in what I've come to expect from both Mr.Lee and Drake that I can't even recall any favorite dish of the evening.   Cost wise, expect to pay on the higher end. Value wise, I found Fring's very lacking since similar dishes can be found at chain restaurants for substantially lower cost. IMO walk a few blocks up and enjoy a great meal at Lee's instead.Β  giving this more than 2 stars because the ambiance and service was great.",neutral

I ordered from their breakfast menu. Got the basics. Eggs, toast, grits and bacon. My husband ordered off the lunch menu and got some sort of sandwich. I can't remember what he ordered exactly but it was like a French dip sandwich. He also said it was pretty tasteless. We may try this place again. The prices were great.

"After all the rave reviews of this restaurant we were very disappointed last night. First of all the restaurant is beautiful inside but small and therefore extremely noisy especially if there is a larger group inside. Last night there was a large group and a group of four drunk  people all of which were Extremely Loud. This is not the fault of the restaurant the loud patrons I mean , however the Acoustics are terrible. We chose to eat outdoors and I have to say I am comparing this to Monarch CafΓ© and there's no comparison. Where as Monarch has a magnificent beautifully lit Courtyard this place has plastic chairs sitting adjacent to Main Street. They have done absolutely nothing to decorate.   You are having a very expensive meal and the outdoor Ambiance is something like a fast food place.  The meal was not spectacular, again I am comparing it to Cafe Monarch. Because they are the same type of restaurant with a limited menu and in fact the chef used to cook at Monarch. The food was nowhere near as interesting. The service was good but nowhere near as excellent as monarch. And it took forever to dine there almost 3 hours. The time between courses was OK until the end and then we must have waited 45 minutes for our main course. The waiter offered to buy us a glass of wine that was nice of him however if I drink too much before I eat I don't care if I eat any more and that pretty much was the case last night.  Now this is another Personal Taste here and I didn't hold it against the restaurant but I didn't care for the location. Watching drunken people especially drunken women in Sky High shoes staggering about  unable to walk in their shoes even sober let alone inebriated  coming up and down Main Street was not particularly my idea of great Entertainment.",neutral
"The brunch dishes were amazing, but the service was lacking. Right after we paid for our $80 brunch, the hostess asked if we could leave and go downstairs to their coffee area. I thought this was very rude since we were only there a little over an hour and paid $80! In Europe and many U.S. Restaurants, this would be frowned upon. We were also never asked if we wanted more coffee (that we poured ourselves). The server asked us once how our food was 1 minute after the meals were dropped, not even enough time to pick up my fork and take a bite. Even though the food was great, that's not the only thing that needs focus in a restaurant. Probably won't return because there are plenty of restaurants in PGH that have good food AND GOOD SERVICE. Sorry for the negative review, but I worked in the service industry for 4.5 years and I would have never asked my customers to move after they tipped me $15.",neutral

Yam/Avocado Roll $5.00 - An interesting twist that isn't at all sushi locations. I saw it and had to try it. Well worth it. Salmon Tempura Rolls $6.00 - Not your standard Salmon Tempura roll but was pleasing. California Roll $6.00 - Standard California Roll, not bad at all.

"So many people said this place was no good or too pricey. I don't think it's cheap, but I think I got fair food for the price compared to other Ramen places. It's only fair to compare all these ramen places against each other given they are all starting around same time. I went to another one earlier this week.  At Momofuku, the portion was definitely bigger than the other two I recently went to. The Momofuku ramen also had two meats in there, the pork belly and some pulled pork. That's something that the other two did not have. So given these two things, putting a larger price isn't so bad.  The one feature of this ramen is really the egg. I was amazed how this poached eggs withstood pressure from my chopstick. I didn't try to puncture, but I was really trying to see what made it move around so easily as not to break. I don't know what it is. But what I like about eggs usually in ramen is i eat a bit of it, eat some noodles, then come back to it. But this one, since it was poached, I had to eat it immediately.  I don't think the broth is bad, but it definitely wasn't as good as some others.  I went on a Friday night, and didn't really have to wait. I guess the place is bigger with more seats, so didn't have the same wait anymore.  I also had this rice pudding with apple and black sesame cookie. The cookie was nice, the apple was nice in the pudding, but I like the pudding to be a bit my milky. The consistency was a bit odd in my opinion, kinda soft but not too soft.  I'd say this is like America's version of Ramen, bigger and more salt.",neutral
I lived here for 6 months.  Had a difficult roommate situation and give 5 stars to management for helping us out.  There were multiple issues of car break-ins and towing so you definitely need to know the rules.  The lot fills up fast and it would be helpful to buy the street pass for $30 a year so you're not up a creek if you get home past 9 pm. The apartments are older so you get what you pay for in that sense.  They've done renovations in the kitchen and the 2 bedroom floor plan is a decent layout but I saw a cockroach in my closet and things just broke a little quicker than I would've liked so I felt like we called maintenance every 2 weeks.

"The service has always been great at SOHO. The food has been good and prices definitely adjusted to the fancy car driving clientele of the neighborhood. It could end up being a pretty expensive dinner for food that is usually not marked up this high. Biscuits are brought out before the meal and they are delicious. Like Shock G said on The Humpty Dance ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits."" The chicken and waffles are good but could be had down the street at XYZ for $4 cheaper and taste just about the same. Anything with country ham on the menu is worth ordering. Most  items are calorie laden but if you want to try to eat something nutritionally decent, the harvest moon salad is a good lunch option. There are a couple of interesting parallels with that dish and Neil Young. Of course the song title and also his mention of country ham in the song Albuquerque. I most enjoyed the chicken-fried pork salad at lunch that has deviled eggs, avocado, bacon, corn, tomato and Green Goddess dressing.  The hush puppies are a great appetizer to share. This is a good brunch option in Ohio City if you crave a hearty and filling meal.",neutral
"I used to take multiple freeway routes just to have a slice or five of Di Fara Special from here. But after my last visit, can't say I'd make a return trek.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Di Fara Special along with an additional cheese topping. To tide us over, we also went for a salad and the calamari appetizer.   There's no denying that deep fried, crunchy calamari is tasty, but there wasn't enough. Thrown into the mix were deep fried slices of cherry peppers and lemon slices -- mm, nope. More calamari and less filler, please.   As we waited for our pizza, our server came by and told us that it wasn't placed in the oven. We were offered complimentary garlic knots as we waited. IMO, the knots were satisfactory. Once the pizza arrived, we noticed the additional cheese topping we ordered wasn't added -- they even charged us for it.   Overall, the pie, as well as the experience were just not as good as the last.",neutral

But what gets me is the pricing compared to the quality.   Today I stopped in to look at some party stuff for an upcoming Bachelorette party. They had a decent selection of items, but the prices for the primarily all plastic, cheaply made items, just seemed too high. If the quality of the products were higher, I wouldn't have as much issue paying those prices.   This place is a good spot to get balloons, though, as well as plastic cutlery and tableware type stuff. They have every color imaginable to fit any theme or decor style.",neutral

When we walked in, we stood there for a couple of minutes before anyone greeted us. Awkward. Our waitress, however, was friendly and efficient.   It's close to home, so we might try it again as it was reasonably priced and I like supporting local businesses. A little more effort could make this place a star.",neutral

Overall we had good service.  You get charged more than the prices on the kid's menus for the actual kid's meal.  The portions are large but the crispy chicken tenders lack any actual flavor.

"I love Tivoli Village, the European-style development in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and not just because of its charming wrought iron balconies, stone facades, water fountains, and faux boulevards.  In a city that prides itself on vast casino spaces bent on sensory overload, it's almost cozy.  Tivoli Village has a quiet energy that encourages meandering among the shops and sitting on benches sipping a cocktail under trees accented with twinkling lavender-colored lights.  It's also close to home, which doesn't hurt.  All that strolling and shopping requires refueling, and Tivoli Village offers a nice variety of places to nosh. One of them is the gourmet burger joint Bottles & Burgers.  One Friday night after work, my husband and I picked up my brother-in-law and headed to B&B to get our burger on.  Kicking off the weekend, the place was hoppin' ... and filled with beautiful people.  The servers are not only selected for their customer service skills, apparently, because they all looked remarkably buff and attractive.  It wasn't just the waitstaff that was easy on the eyes; a majority of the patrons were good looking as well.  Not sure how well we fit into that mix, but no one made us feel uncomfortable.  Our booth was roomy but located right next to the restroom, a little too close for my taste.  More hustle and bustle than we wanted, but not too bad.  We started with an order of onion rings accompanied by a creamy green salsa.  The onion rings were nicely battered and crisp, and I really enjoyed the salsa.  The creaminess gave it a body that worked well with the rings, which wouldn't have been the case with a typical salsa.  It was nice step up from the standard ketchup and mustard.  I ordered a veggie burger that came with homemade potato chips.  My husband went with a nacho-style burger. My brother-in-law chose the sliders with a side order of fries and a milkshake.  The milkshake came first, along with the onion rings, and we all enjoyed a few slurps of chocolaty goodness.  It was delish!  The fries were another unqualified hit.  With both cheese sauce and gravy, they were yummy.  My bro-in-law wasn't wowed by the sliders but enjoyed them.  The homemade chips were bland enough to let the burger flavors shine... assuming they were there to shine.  My husband wasn't wild about the cheese sauce on his burger - he prefers his fromage shredded - but the tortilla chip strips stayed crunchy, and the burger was well done, just as he requested.  My veggie burger, unfortunately, was a disappointment.  It was mushy and lacked pizazz.  Even with a slice of cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms on top, it remained blah.  I didn't finish it.  I firmly believe that a meal isn't complete without a bit of sweet, and both my husband and I indulged.  My husband's banana split reached new heights - literally and figuratively - of gourmet-ness, piled with whipped cream and topped with sugar art.  No real difference in taste from the diner version, which my husband appreciated.  He likes his classics to be classic, so he was happy.  I tried the opera cake.  It sure looked lovely with cocoa polka dots, a dainty dollop of whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The taste was just so-so.  I was bummed because I relish my desserts, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Can't win 'em all, I guess.  The verdict on B&B? Fun atmosphere with interesting selections that don't always live up to their billing.  Worth a second visit.",neutral

"Take N' Bake your own pizza.  Second location for this new concept.  You order the style of pizza you want.  Take it home and follow the baking instructions and there you have it.  Hot and fresh pizza.  They say it is all natural, fresh and homemade.  The pizza is put in a plastic wrap with parchment paper under it.  You cook it on the parchment paper, take it out of the oven, let it cool a few minutes and then it is time to eat. The menu includes some fresh salads and some sweets including cookies that you bake.  This take N' bake concept can be OK in some cases, but I usually want my Pizza cooked so I can eat it now.  But I have had some take N' bake from another pizza place and cooked for a party.    Had a Signature Pie, The Artisan, that has spinach, crumbed feta, Sun-Dried tomato and more.

"Located right off the casino floor in the Cosmopolitan, The Henry is a classy, fancy looking restaurant that serves up classic American diner food. It was about 8pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated really quickly.  We started off with some buffalo wings, which were pretty spicy! They were cooked really well, and we were also given wet wipes to clean up the unavoidable mess that comes with chicken wings. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, but had asked for the blue cheese dressing to come on the side. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was disappointed to find out that it had not come on the side. The chicken was kind of soggy from all the dressing and water from the tomatoes, that it wasn't really that enjoyable. It was really flavorful, however, and tasted just like the chicken wings!   I opted to order the sandwich with a side of tater tots, which they fry in truffle oil. I had never had truffle oil before, so I was put off by the smell, and had to remove the tater tots from in front of me because it was so nauseating. This is nothing against them, just something that I wasn't expecting.  Overall, I would not pay the price we did for this meal, but it is pretty standard in the Las Vegas area. Other than forgetting my request, our server was really friendly and quick. They also serve breakfast all day, so it's kind of like a fancier and more expensive Denny's, and the quality is not much better than I what would expect from Denny's either.",neutral

"I tried Taste for breakfast today.  I love their clean, modern look ,that J&W students prepare the grub for you and that there is a Sprouts-esque place there but I still miss Sprouts. Taste has an omelet bar which also doubles as a breakfast sandwich station and they also offer an omelet of the day or you can create your own. They get brownie points in my book for offering egg white omelets and have a nice selection of add ins. Omelet was good but didn't seem to gel too well together so I think I will stick to making my own at home. While waiting for my omelet, I looked at the prices of their sandwiches and it seemed a little more than I would like to spend for lunch so think this will be a breakfast only place for me when I want a sandwich. Unfortunately since it was right before the holiday and breakfast time, I didn't get the entire Taste experience.  The cashier seemed too involved with her conversation with a random and just sucked her teeth when she told me the price so that turned me off a bit. When you're at work, act professional and do your job, even if you're a college student (younger me is shaking her head at current me for saying this).

"I know Moe's probably doesn't want to be considered ""fast"" food, but did I really have to wait 15 minutes in line today just to get my lunch?  And, lest you think it was crowded, let me assure you that it wasn't.  There were 3 of us in line...and 3 people behind the counter.  And it took me 15 minutes from start to finish.  Thanks for eating up my lunchtime, Moe's!    I've been to this Moe's before, but today was definitely the most inefficient of my visits.  It was as if Tuesday was ""New Hires"" Day -- yea!  Watching the person try to roll up my burrito was excruciatingly  painful.  Then I did the unthinkable.  I asked to use a coupon for a free bowl of hot queso that Moe's had sent me for signing up for their email club.  GASP!  I did not want the lunch combo that includes a small side of queso.  I wanted the free bowl with coupon (for which they charge a whopping $3.50 normally!) on the side so I could share it with my co-worker.  And, no, I didn't want to just get the combo and save the coupon to use it another time.  It expires in two weeks, and do you think I want to come back before then after this experience?  Again, I was quite sure I didn't want the combo that I have to pay extra for and includes a small container of queso in addition to the large cup that was entitled to get for free.  I realized it would make it SO much easier for the fresh-out-of-cashier-school cashier to ring me up, but I really just want the one burrito and one side of queso, and I wanted to use the coupon that was sent to me as a ""valuable"" member of the Moe's email club.  No, I didn't want a soft drink, just water, please.  The cashier wasn't quite sure how to ring it up, so we went round and round, and the cashier had to pull in the burrito wrapper for help.  15 minutes after I stepped into line, I was out of there, on my way to my table, and miraculously only paid for one burrito.  God bless Moe's.  The meal was good overall (thankfully my burrito was wrapped in foil to keep it warm), but I'm still more of a Qdoba fan.  Besides being more efficient, their burritos have better flavor.  The good thing about Moe's, though, is that they give you free chips and have a salsa bar where I can dive into my favorite tomatillo salsa.  And the queso was good, if not a little runny.  But certainly not worth $3.50.",neutral

"Had two different experiences, went once for a facial w/ acne add on and loved it so much that I went back to try out their hair stylist.   Let's start off with the facial: It was fabulous. The room was all the way back away from the louder area of the salon/spa so it was really quiet. I was so happy about that because that is the worst thing-listening to other people in the hallway while you're trying to relax. The lady who performed the service was amazing and so skilled. I melted in her hands and it was the best facial i've ever had.  They had some offer as I was checking out that I would be entered into a raffle for prebooking appointments which I did- but left the ticket on the counter. Called back 10 minutes after I left and all I got was a sorry :/   For the haircut: This will break down into another two sections: the haircut and the style. For the cut itself I was not displeased, but I wasn't in love with the cut either. It doesn't seem like any weight was taken out of my hair and the layers weren't as distinct as I normally have them. If I had gone for a style alone I would have left one star. It was a blowdry that I would have expected from someone still in school. My hair was a big frizz ball and didn't look like I had just come from a salon and spent $55 for a level 4 stylist. (one of their mid-high stylist)  As I left I asked the front desk what they thought, they thought I looked great, very unenthusiastically ;) I took a picture and sent it to their manager--she offered a free style. Great, but I wasn't too excited to back anytime soon.   I'll be back for another facial--but still searching for a good stylist!",neutral
"Vanilla bean cheesecake was decadent and yummy but did not have a hint of vanilla bean flavor. The crust was also rock hard and literally impossible to put my fork through. I really don't understand the point of having such a rock solid crust. Chocolate chip cookie sandwich was soft and tasty. Salted caramel coconut macaroon was delicious (I love caramel and coconut) but was sorely lacking in salt. Salted caramel brownie was very fudgey and decadent! The champagne cupcake was very pretty but bland, did not taste like anything special. Wish they had more cupcake choices. My friends really liked the peanut butter chocolate cake and the birthday macaron. I feel like I tried a good variety of things and wasn't exactly amazed, especially at these prices, but I didn't hate it either. It's essentially just a cute place to take good Instagram pictures and eat something sweet.  Service was mediocre, cold and unfriendly.

This place is a decent steakhouse but there isn't anything too special about it. Pretty standard items on the menu but they do them well. Service is average for speed. Attention to requests is spotty. Hostess stand is usually slow.   Ambience is decently upscale. There is a bar area with TVs if you're looking to watch sports.  We generally come here for something close in the neighborhood but overall an average place with decent food.,neutral

We got a recommendation from the bartender to get the spinach mozz sticks....these were....not good. Yikes. He made it sound like fried spinach artichoke dip....that it was not. The spinach made the texture weird and took away the yummy cheese stick flavor. I also ordered their minestrone soup...now that was good!

"Recently have been disappointed in this place, as the service is appallingly slow and the food quality has been slowly dropping (mainly looking at the Chu Chee Fish). Here are some of the dishes we've tried: - Chu Chee Fish: great flavorful panang sauce with crisp breading on the fish. However, the sauce will be spicy even if you order it at the ""no spice"" level- speaking from experience. The thickness of the fish has noticeably dropped over the months we've eaten here. - Yellow Curry w/ Chicken: a decent amount of meat with the curry; my only complaint is the lack of rice that comes with the dish",neutral
"One of the better food choices if you want to stay away from the high concentration of pubs or bars in the area. Attached to the Delta Hotel, the service is attentive and there is plenty of seats in a slightly fancier environment to enjoy a drink or watch a game.   I walked in fully intending to order a salad, but got waylayed by the 5 cheese mac and cheese on the menu. It was creamy, heavy. and comforting. I was only able to finish half of it, so maybe the better plan is to split it with someone and order something healthy to counter balance all the carbs and cheese.",neutral

But it was on the way home so I decided to try it. I was greeted as soon I came in, the staff is full of aloha, very helpful. Clean, comfortable environment. I asked what was the popular dish and they suggested the notorious rib, so I got that. Took it home and ate it...meh... it's different. They put a sauce on it where the first couple bites were good, but then I got used to the flavor and it didn't appeal to me anymore. Not sure if I'll come back, this is just my opinion, I'm sure a lot of people like it",neutral

"I've been here several times for both dinner and happy hour. Although I have usually had slow service, this Friday was the worst.  I came in with a group of friends at about midnight for reverse happy hour. We didn't leave until almost 1:30 and not because we were having so much fun enjoying happy hour. It took us 30 minutes to get our food after we ordered, except my boyfriend. He had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and tell him they actually ran out of the corn dogs he ordered. Someone else in our group had also ordered the corn dogs and gotten them, so I don't understand how it took another 15 minutes for the kitchen to realize they were out.  The food that we actually got just wasn't up to par. My friend's potato chips were kind of soggy. The beef tenderloin nachos I had didn't even have beef tenderloin! Instead, it had scoops of the meat from the sloppy joe sliders.   I understand it was a busy night downtown with the Sade concert and First Friday going on and that District was busier than normal. I appreciate that our server was super apologetic about the service. But the manager seemed like she could care less, and as an apology she offered us a free appetizer. After waiting for over 30 minutes for food, the last thing we wanted was more food. When my boyfriend asked if she could just comp his beer instead (which was cheaper than any appetizer) she made a face before agreeing.  My overall experience with District has been good, and I will be back. Their happy hour food is usually delicious! But if they can't figure out how to improve the speed of service and make consistently good food, I may have to rethink my decision.",neutral

"I re-located from Texas to Nevada. I applied for several apartments, but I chose Cheyenne Villas. I had not heard any negative reviews regarding this property. I have been here since February 2017. Everything that I asked for has been handled in a timely and efficient manner. They did have a rude employee in the leasing office, but she is gone. I find that LaShelle, Linda and Lee are very kind and understanding and they attempt to handle any issues that arise. I recently moved to a larger unit and on this side of the property, there are a LOT of children. My original apartment was very quiet. The children tend bother things, dump trash on the ground instead of in the trash containers, flip the major breaker switch (my switch does not have a cover) so that I have no electricity, but kids are kids. And the maintenance staff really do a great job keeping the property neat and clean. I really feel that the staff here are Cheyenne Villas are very good. I have no intention of moving out soon. I don't have a negative thing to say about this property. There is no perfect place to live. But, I feel safe here and I recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice place to live.",neutral

"Good place for salad. As good a salad bar as I have ever seen except for the odd placement of the bar itself. You get in line and fill plates with salad.

Okay pizza and pretty good muffins. Pasta. Soups that range from delicious to ""I can make better soup at home"" soup. Pepsi products. Tea. Sweet lemonades and a dessert bar that is at best an undiscerning little childs dream. Not a bad place at all except i personally think a little bit high on price.

There were plenty of empty tables (odd for uptown during the noon hour). After we were seated, we weren't greeted by our waitress for several minutes. After placing both our drink and lunch orders, it took another several minutes to get our drinks. The food was not quick to be served, either. I had the falafel, it came with a salad. Both were fine but not anything I'd have a burning desire to come back for.   If there wasn't a wait for a table, I had ample time to dally and I really wanted (poor) table service, I'd go back if pressed. If I just wanted a good, quick falafel, I'd go to Pita Pit.

"I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.  We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice.   My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something.   For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area.",neutral

"This is good value, basic Thai food, mildly authentic, served at cheap prices.  The FOOD:  The spring rolls are super tasty and super addictive.  Just trust your instincts: if they feel hot when you pick them up, they will burn your tongue when you eat them ;)  The basil pad thai is a nice twist on things.  Their curries are good, but not terribly authentic.  These flavors are being cooked by Chinese people for white folk, so don't expect the full Thai experience.  The SERVICE: Rather inconsistent.  It seems to alternate between one waiter who's really on top of things and another waiter that just stares into space instead of noticing that your water has been empty for 15 minutes.  Be prepared to flag staff down when you want something...don't be shy.    This is basic Thai food served at basic prices.  If you're in the Village or near Yonge-Wellesley, there's really nothing better...in fact some of the alternatives here are pretty disgusting.",neutral

"We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant however the waitress makes or breaks the evening.  More on that later.  We started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool.  He made a fantastic Sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the USA.  The four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  This place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.  We had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  The waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  She was making the motions.  Likely tired because it was Badger Homecoming Saturday and they were busy.  We were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  She said I don't know and can check.  When she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  What??  What restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  Oh well, move on...  Each of us DID enjoy our meal.  We had the Crawfish Cheesecake for appetizer.  It was like a cheesecake?  Different and good.  Two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  None of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  The food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  If you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.  In summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!",neutral

"A popular tacos restaurant that has been popping up in several locations around Toronto along with it's ever popular sidecar business of Sweet Jesus. We walked in on a weekday looking for a late dinner and was greeted by a sparsely lit space with booming rap music. I'm not sure what I expected from a tacos place, but it definitely wasn't darkness and a heavy bass.   Decor, music and atmosphere aside, the food itself was a hit and miss. The Avocado Mango Salad was fresh and bright, a great accompaniment to the tacos. The Carne Asada taco was delicious, the beef steak was tender and balanced perfectly against the toppings of salsa, avocado and cilantro. The In Cod We Trust taco was really odd, something about the toppings and the fish didn't work for me. Maybe it had too much red cabbage? I didn't like that one. Also, the portions are small for the price. After two tacos I would be normally still be hungry if it wasn't so late at night.   In all, the experience was okay. The tacos are good but pricey and small.",neutral

"My sister, mom and I came here for facials.  We each had a groupon for a 1 hour custom facial.  Both my mom and sister had a great experience with Phoenix and Terry.  I, however, had a lackluster experience with a woman named Oksana.  This was our first visit, and my first facial EVER.  Oksana never introduced herself to me (I got her name from her business card she left me at the end) nor did she ask me any questions at all about my skin.  She simply left me to change into the robe and once she came back she went straight to work.  Fine.  I'm not much for conversation anyway.  I thought it was strange that she never told me what she was doing as she was doing it (like I said, I've never had a facial so I had no idea what was going on) and never asked me about any concerns I had with my skin, problem areas, products I used, etc.  The only time she even spoke to me was to ask me how often I had facials done, and when I told her that I never do, she scoffed and told me I needed one once a month because my acne is so bad.  I'll admit that I have had issues with acne since my early 20's but it comes and goes and is only really bad during those extra hormonal times.  Then she told me she couldn't do any massage (which was included in the package) because my acne was so bad and would be exacerbated by the massage.  She rubbed a gritty mask on my face and left me in the room alone for about 10 minutes, telling me not to get up and just relax.  Ha.  She came back and finished up and then without saying a word lowered the bed and told me to make an appt. for three weeks out and when I came back she could make some product suggestions. HA HA.  Please.  As if I would come back to see her again.  I also ended up having to wipe all the gritty crap off my face in the restroom before leaving because my skin felt disgusting.  The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because my mom and sister had a wonderful experience.",neutral

"The food  is good. You will not be disappointed. The staff is friendly. The menu is not very surprising. I can't say it is an amazing restaurant. It is just good and overpriced for what they offer. I ordered a meal number 45. I got noodles, 4 pieces of crab, a tiny piece of beef and a tiny spring roll. The size was just right to feel not hungry, but not too full. It tasted really good. But for almost 13$ you sort of expect a little more than noodles, 4 crabs, a tiny roll and a tiny piece of meat. The meal literally cost them not more than 1.50$ -2$ to prepare.  I wished they had more soup varieties in smaller bowls as entrees. I don't want to pay 10$ and get a huge soup as I don;t always like to make a soup to my main dish. Also, I wished they had more authentic salads, like a lotus stem salad.   However, the place is clean, it was recommended to me, the staff is very friendly and make sure you have a good experience.The food tastes well.  Get there on time. It is very small and I know people like that place.",neutral
"I don't know what to say about reviewing a Gourmet Fine Foods place, because there's a lot you have to consider. First of all, my perspective is someone who usually shops at No Frills/Asian supermarkets etc. Now, let's begin.   Obviously, it's different. It's in a category of its' own a.k.a UPscale. For me, when I have previous knowledge of something, it alters my perspective. This is also known as  e x p e c t a t i o n s.  I mean, if you know this place is going to be gourmet, you're going to have a certain standards. Like so:   1. I expect a more sophisticated group of shoppers (the rich) 2. I expect a reguar bag of chips to be almost 2x more expensive. 3. I expect the quality produce to be fresh and not even have to THINK about considering if it's ripe or not. 4. I expect to find everything up-to-date and not have to worry about expired foods on the shelf. 5. I expect friendly, genuine, and knowledgeable staff at hand. 6. I expect the quality of the food to modernize their store.  Don't you?  So, these are MY expectations, but the big question is... did they meet them?   Not quite.   Here's why:  The atmosphere is certainly nice. I always like a change from the regular No Frills stop to a nice treat like, Pusateri. But, I'll be honest, their staff are pretty much the same you'd find at No Frills.  I ordered a Soy Chai Latte and a carrot cake. The barista forgot my order, so I had to wait a bit longer. He was apologetic about the delay, and I was too. In the time I waited, I should have cancelled my order as it was a cup of dissapointing, watered down, underspiced 'latte'. Even my sister, who has never tried a soy chai latte said 'it tastes like nothing.'  On the other hand, my carrot cake was not bad. The icing was average. As for the cake itself, quite moist, and for $2.50, I'd say the portion was pretty decent. I'm still on the hunt for the best carrot cake in Toronto (suggestions would be great)   I also tried a cheese cake and many other desserts from Pusateri's, but I can't judge those because Pusateri is only the womb which the baby is born in. If I were to actually criticize, I'd have to see the baby itself. So Rahier's Patisserie's, watch out. 'cause you'll be reviewed next seeing as though you provide Pusateri with your cakes!  *On a lighter note, their produce is certainly top-notch. I've never tried their hot foods, but it does look quite delicious. But like I said before, the experience itself shopping in such a place like this should be one left with full satisfation and I was not fully satisfied. (I guess this note didn't turn out so light...)",neutral

"Went in here because I was craving asian food, and the sign clearly advertised ""pan-asian"" cuisine. I don't see what's so ""pan-asian"" about the place-- seems like your ordinary Chinese restaurant to me. I needed some lunch so i decided to give it a shot, so what the hey?  The management seems nice enough. Clearly it is owned/managed by actual chinese people so i suppose that ought to be somewhat reassuring when seeking out any sort of ethnic cuisine. The lunch special was well priced at 6 bucks, and included an egg roll.  The egg roll was your average spring roll. Probably would have been nice if it had been served with some sweet and sour sauce but I was too lazy to ask for some. I ordered the szechuan chicken, an item that you don't always see at your typical chinese fast food restuarants. It was decent-- fair amount of sliced chicken served with sliced onion, bell pepper, carrots, ginger and glazed in a dark sauce. It was quite salty and did not require additional soy sauce ( i imagine that was already added) and the spiciness seemed to come from some sort of pepper oil. It was spicy enough to satisfy my palate-- I didn't feel the need to ask for additional hot sauce. I was satisfactorily filled and thanked them for a pleasant meal.  The verdict: Nothing special to say here, this is your run of the mill sit down chinese restaurant. The food quality is good enough to earn your business, but I don't think it's worth going out of your way for. You could probably find tastier food at a PF changs to be honest but these guys aren't a bad deal if you find yourself in the spring valley area.",neutral

"My friend was right! The Mahi fish tacos are pretty good! They are grilled so you don't feel as bad about eating them. The firecracker shrimp tacos have a little kick in the flavor, but they are definitely not spicy.  I ordered hurricane rice instead of fries to go with the seafood tacos, but I guess the waitress forgot to tell them, so I ended up with fries. The regular fries were overcooked and lacked taste. It was a strange texture because once you bit into the fries, there was a crunch but it seemed like nothing was inside the fries. My other friend got the sweet potato fries, which I didn't know was even available, and that was much better than the regular fries. I'm not sure if it's always this way with the fries, or we just tasted the regular fries on a ""bad"" day, but just to be sure, I'm going to order the sweet potato fries next time.

All seem to be nice and helpful. Food wise, the sushi portion to rice ratio is a little off, sometimes more rice than other sushi restaurants. Food taste is pretty good to mediyoker depending on what you order.  This place doesn't seem to get overly packed, but it's a decent enough place to go to if you are craving sushi and in the area.

"I've had a take out menu on my fridge for this place for two years at least but I never ordered from them because I'm lazy and I generally only order from a place if I can order online.  Anything to avoid that whole talking-to-a-real-person thing.  Anytime I try a new Chinese place I order all of my favorites at once just so I know if it's worth a second time around.  There were some highs and lows and in-betweens.  1. Wonton Egg Drop Soup - Nothing on any Chinese menu will ever be better than putting the two best soups in the world together.... unless you get it from Gold Chef.  I'm glad I only ordered the small because I didn't even finish that.  The wontons were fine, but the broth was so bland.  It was basically just egg water... I want you to sit and think about what egg water might taste like... you got a lock down in your mind on that? That's right.  Egg water.  It was really, really horrible.  Zero stars for the soup.  2.  Crab Puffs - These were fine.  Not any detectable crab, but they weren't over sweet like so many tend to be.  I would order these again.    3.  Egg Rolls - A few people mentioned that there is no meat in these, but there most certainly was a noticeable amount of pork in mine.  So please, if you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, this is NOT something you want to order.  Do not listen to the other reviews who say it's all vegetable.  That all being said, they are tasty.  Sufficiently crispy and flavorful with a good ratio of wrapper to filling.  4. Lemon Chicken - The chicken is breaded, not battered, which is a plus in my book.  The lemon sauce was also probably the best lemon sauce I've ever had.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, though.  It's very sweet and tastes almost like a lemon glaze for pies rather than something for a savory dish, but I thought it tasted awesome with the chicken.  This is gonna be a judgment call on if you think you'd like a sweeter sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't as dry as the breaded chicken tends to be in other places, so that was a bonus as well.  5. Singapore Mei Fun - No one ever has and probably ever will beat the PF Changs version of this dish (Singapore Street Noodles) but this one was decent.  The chicken and pork seemed a little dry and not very fresh, but the flavor was fine and the shrimp was cooked well.  I might have liked it just a touch spicier though.  Overall, everything was very good, but I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 star rating because the soup was just THAT BAD.  The only way I'd order again is if I had a craving for something specific and didn't really want soup.  Sadly, I usually only order Chinese food when I have a soup craving specifically.  Such a shame that the most important component for me was the one horrible thing I got.",neutral

"I am really surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. Did we eat at the same place? Don't get me wrong, some of the food was good. But I don't think it was $75 good. My friend Rachel and I came in for brunch on Sunday 2/21. You can find this place in a small shopping center where BFE meets Far as hell. (Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde). It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 30 minutes and then we were seated inside at a small table in the back. I would have preferred to have eaten outside because it was such a beautiful day, but luckily our table was all by itself, although it was still a tight squeeze. We were given room temperature water, with no ice, and then some menus. We had a game plan and knew we wanted to try a bunch of things, so we both ordered what we wanted and then split everything. We tried:  Peach and Pineapple mimosas $6 each- I had the peach and thought it was tasty and reasonably priced. I wish they had a bottomless option though, because who doesn't love bottomless mimosas during brunch?   Croque Madame $11- This was very good. This sandwich was made with challah bread, thick ham, gruyere cheese and a sunny side up egg, then the whole thing was covered in bechamel sauce. It was savory, salty and cheesy. It came with a side salad of arugula and tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing which was good  Pb&J pancakes $13- Probably my favorite thing I tried. The pancakes were really sweet although there was minimal pb&j. I added some of their housemade vanilla syrup and yeah I'd like to purchase a bottle of that stuff asap.  Social Pecan Roll $3- We originally wanted the monkey bread but they were out, so we got this instead. It came out warm and had a nice flavor.  Jalapeno Bacon $4- It's bacon and it's jalapeno flavored. What's not to love?  Biscuits $3- The biscuits came out hot and were served with house made jam. These are the poster child of how biscuits should be-flaky, buttery and delicious.  Tostada $8- There are actually 2 tostadas to an order, which was perfect since we were sharing. The tostada had pork, black beans, slaw and a quail egg. There was also some sauce drizzled over the top of the tostada.   Breakfast Taquitos $9- The taquitos also had a slaw on top of them, this one was a lil spicy and had jalapenos but was quite good. I found myself eating the slaw by itself after the taquitos were long gone. The taquito itself was not memorable though.  Rachel also got coffee and a fruit cup for her son, which by the way took forever to arrive. I don't know if they don't have highchairs but we weren't offered one, so maybe think twice about bringing young kiddos. Our total for both meals was $75. Now I am by no means cheap, but this is ridonkulous for brunch. Looking back, I can't believe we spent that much money especially since we only ordered 2 main plates. We did get a military discount and that did knocked the price down $14, but nothing was so amazing that I have to come back and spend that much money again. All in all I think this was my first and last time here. The service was intermittent. Our food took about an hour to come out of the kitchen. They were out of 2 of the items (monkey bread and empanadas) we originally ordered so we had to settle for other things. And it was really warm in the dining room and made our dining experience a bit unpleasant.",neutral

"The conference center was freezing cold for most of the three days I was there, and it was only mid-thirties outside. Apparently the loading dock had been left open indefinitely, and it was chilling the rooms so much that space heaters had to be brought into the presentation rooms.   I have to give kudos to the kitchen, though. I really enjoyed all the meals I had at the hotel with the exception of the red velvet cake (which had frosting that tasted more like vanilla pudding then cream cheese).  My hotel room was adequate, but it took a full day to warm up with the heat on constantly, and the outlet that fed the coffee maker was broken.",neutral

"We went to Jason's Deli Saturday evening.  The place had some customers, I'd say about 20-25% capacity.  There were 2 people ahead of us in line to order.  There was only one cashier with 3 potential registers.  Appeared to be a little short staffed.  It took about 10 minutes until our order was placed.

"I have received delivery from this restaraunt three times.  The first two times went well and the food was very good...even once when they ran out of ribs and phoned me to ask if they could substitute broasted chicken for a half slab of ribs, the customer service was great and the chicken was really good.  However, the third time I ordered food from this location did not go so well.  I ordered an 8 piece chicken combo meal.  The menu advertises this meal as two of each piece of chicken (breast, thigh, leg and wing) and two sides, but that is not what I received.  I received 4 thighs, 3 legs, and 1 wing...yes that adds up to eight pieces of chicken but not as advertised on the menu and included no breasts.  Also, I ordered the macaroni salad as one of the sides...mind you this is for an eight piece combo dinner...I received one 3.25 oz container of macaroni salad, which is the size of one container of salad dressing.  The menu also states that the combo dinners are served with garlic bread, which was not included in the delivery.  I will reiterate the food is good thus the three star rating, but the attention to detail was not adequate.  I will order from this restaraunt again because the food is good....if the order comes as advertised on the menu, I will chalk this last experience up as a fluke and will improve my overall rating for this restaraunt.",neutral

"As an out of towner I was excited to check this place out. Our dear friends had brought me a pound of their beans which I thoroughly enjoyed. The ambiance is unique and noteworthy. I tried a cheddar jalapeΓ±o muffin which was a nice blend of sweet and savory. The coffee on the other hand was underwhelming. I got a whiteout cappuccino and my wife got a vanilla latte. Upon tasting the espresso in both drinks, I could taste an unpleasant bitterness which I describe as chemical or turpentine. This usually means the beans were improperly roasted. I also think the microfoam on the cappuccino could have been prepared better as it was more bubbly than a good cappuccino normally has.   I could have visited on an off day as I know I have had good beans from here before. Off days happen sometimes.",neutral

"My husband and I decided to try this place out during our first visit to Pittsburgh. We were initially attracted Because looked really nice from the outside.  The decor inside was nice. The host seated is promptly. Our server was over quite promptly as well and was very nice. My husband ordered the chicken wings and the fries pickles. I ordered the ribs. Our food was out in a reasonable time. My husband enjoyed his choices. Unfortunately, my ribs were way over done and I was barely able to cut them. It took a little while before our server was back so that I could mention the issue. Once I mentioned it he was very apologetic and offered to have it remade which was nice. I decided against it. Shortly thereafter the manager came over and asked what the problem was and I explained to him as well. He was very courteous. In the end, they removed the food from the bill without hesitation. Overall our experience wasn't terrible here but the food was not stellar. If you are just going for drinks it is definitely a nice place with a nice atmosphere and good customer service. The three stars is strictly due to the food experience.",neutral

But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,  They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc.   They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.  Don't expect great service.   The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon.   If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here.

"Guys, don't throw stones at me.  I LIKED Barrington's.  I would give them a solid 3.8 stars.  They are better than ""Ok"" but not as good as ""yay I'm a fan.""  As others have stated, the ambiance is quaint, quiet, intimate.  I love that.  The service was OK for us.  The waitress seemed a little ""rough"" and just didn't provided the polished professionalism you would expect at a place like this.  She had a couple of recommendations for wine based on the description of what I wanted and I think she provided decent options but neither truly hit the spot.    I ordered the butternut squash soup and one of the salads.  Both were done very well and I liked that I could order a ""half order"" so it wasn't too much and I wasn't too full before my entrΓ©e.  I went with the swordfish for my main meal.  It was OK.  It had a crispy crust around it but the fish itself was pretty fishy.  The menu said it came with white beans, broccoli rabe and chorizo.  You couldn't really taste or find many pieces of chorizo and for some reason the flavor combinations didn't work THAT well.  I mostly just tasted fishy fish with bitter broccoli.  The truffled mashed potatoes were amazing but they came out lukewarm which was disappointing.    We went against our server's recommendations (as she had suggested a couple other things we didn't agree with earlier in the evening) and decided to try the blueberry sticky bun and the smore's crΓ¨me brulee.  Both get an A for effort, NO doubt.  They both get an A for creativity as well.  They both get a B in terms of flavor and overall enjoyment.    I just don't feel confident to say this is the best restaurant in Charlotte.  I have had better dining experiences elsewhere.

"Let's hold the phone here for a minute people-- solid sandwich place? Yeah I'm with you.   Best sandwich in Las Vegas? Not even close, bub.  This particular location gets a fair amount of late night traffic. I can't deny that yours truly was out with some friends enjoying the Ghostbar and Moon before stopping by for a sandwich at 3:30. Very cool that they are open so late. I agree with other reviewers-- this is probably your best option in the surrounding food court so go for it if it's there.  I ordered a soup for my friend and got myself an All-American. It seems to be a popular choice, and is a direct competitor of The Bobble, or as it is known by some patrons, the Thanksgiving sub at Capprioti's. You'll taste a hint of sweet cranberry sauce and fair amount of turkey, and a rich creamy ranch. The flavors certainly complement each other  well but it's far from the most memorable sandwich in vegas. The price is pretty reasonable and I think they are a good value. Worth stopping by if you are enjoying a late evening at the Palms, but let's not get carried away with the accolades.",neutral

"I normally come through the drive-thru during the day and the service is normally really good. They're quick and are always greeting you with a smile and making sure they have your order right. One thing they advertise is the face-to-face interaction when making your order. Unfortunately, most of the time I go through with someone or with a big order, by the time we get to the window, we've forgotten our order! It would be nice if there was a smaller menu of some sort next to the order window for those of us who forget our order!  I went through the drive-thru last night and it took me forever! We drove past the first two windows, which was understandable since it was late at night. I figured maybe they just didn't have enough people. The cook took my order! Someone else came to ring me up and the cook washed her hands and went towards the back again, but it's like, seriously? They shouldn't be THAT short-staffed! Then, I was waiting for my order at the second window, and they looked like they were either cleaning out the area or restocking since the tea containers were in the middle of the floor. One of the workers was wiping down the area then went towards the back. When he left, I noticed there was some cashier/front worker (whatever you call those guys) just standing around eating a slurpee. He looked at me, looked away, and then gave himself some more of the slurpee looking thing and kept on at it. Not working at all. Meanwhile, the manager comes by to refill the cups. Why is she doing what he was supposed to be doing? If you're on break, it's understandable, but at least go out of sight so you don't make yourself look bad!

"I walked by their poster advertising Taco Tuesday and Thursday, and being curious about Asian fusion food, I decided to buy some...on a Wednesday. I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it, but I was disappointed. By no means did they taste bad, but they weren't great either. I was kind of irked by the sogginess. It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the ""taco"" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy.

"I really wanted to like this place. I found the calamari to be chewy and undercooked. Minestrone was bland. Chicken Marsala was lacking flavor as well. My boyfriend had the pasta & fagioli which was very tasty and pasta carbonera, which was also very tasty. The server was attentive and kept glasses and breadbaskets full. The hostess needs to go.

I came after seeing some ads they posted on their FB page about a Mother's Day sale. Small inventory but they surprisingly had some good selections on clothing that day.   Not too much furniture at this location and the customer service was very friendly. If you are not too sensitive about the area, then you just might find some vintage finds here.",neutral

Good lunch spot if you work in the area and need something that is reliably fast. They are super-efficient here -- they bring you miso soup and green tea before you've even ordered.

"Taste: I ordered off of their lunch menu which is available from 11:30 to 5:00. The lunch combo comes with a Tom Yum Thai Hot & Spicy Soup which was flavourless and was not Tom Yummy at all. It also comes with a Vegetarian Spring Roll which was nothing special. For the dish, I had the Mussamun Curry Beef Brisket. This I thought was great because the beef brisket was nice and tender, and I really enjoyed the peanut flavour of the curry.   Service: The service was good. Nothing bad happened, and nothing exceptionally good happened.  Value: I think that the prices are really good here, even though part of my lunch wasn't so great. The whole combo was $9.95 which is super affordable for a decent Thai lunch.  Ambiance: Nice Thai themed decor and a lot of table room.",neutral

It was a much better choice. I will likely return to try the breakfast burrito. Those also looked good on the menu. I'll give it a shot.",neutral

Its reasonable here.  The prices are okay for the quality of food you get and this was my first time coming here so ordering was a little different but its not my first restaurant ordering that way.  When you walk in you pass the first ordering window to get in line to order your food and seat yourself which is more convenient with getting your food the minute you order instead of waiting.  Everything is ordered separately meat sides and drink.  As for the barbeque sauce a lot of people were using the sissy sauce i prefer the other one its less sweet but just my preference.  I would like to see more sides on the menu and then maybe a cornbread instead of just regular slices of bread.  I will probably come here again but i am still searching for really good barbeque.,neutral

"The owner replied below. Here is my reply. I HAVE had eggplant parmesan at your restaurant before and it was fine, as can be expected, it fitted the common expectation and standard description of the dish. Whatever i had w that alfredo sauce was not that, it was haphazardly thrown together, barely eatable and by no standard of any italian cooking can it be called an eggplant parm ( a dish i usually LOVE), for one there was no parmesan cheese in it. The dish was just eggplant, not well cooked, not good, covered in sauce with random chunks of mozz & ricotta cheese. I'll change my stars from 1 to 3 because i feel bad letting my bad experience affect your business, my issue is more w the waiter who Claimed he saw breadcrumbs. But  to keep telling me that what i was served was not a mistake, that is some version of the dish, is ridiculous.   I really want to like this place, it's cute, but when the attitude is so hoity you better come correct..and it just dont. Tonight's dinner was a travesty. I ordered an eggplant parmesan w Alfredo sauce instead of marinara. It came looking odd. I questioned it but was assured by waiter that it was normal. It wasn't, all this was, was a stack of dry thick eggplant with chunks of ricotta, mozz & alfredo thrown on too. It was not at all an eggplant paRm, i decided to make the best of it, cus they act at this restaurant like complaining or questioning is strictly forbidden. Before leaving I reported to the waiter, just as an Fyi, that mine was really not an eggplant parm, and he started arguing w me. I said ""i've had it many times, it's supposed to be thin sliced eggplant fried in breadcrumbs and parmesan etc"". he said : ""i saw breadcrumbs"" what?! Where?! I think i know what was in it, i ate it and am telling you what was on my plate in front of me for 20 min. I didnt send it back out of courtesy, hated that ineatable slop, paid for it, tipped well, and they can't even give me the courtesy of taking my notes at face value? I understand mistakes can be made, but when they look you in the face and deny the glaring obvious issues like you're lying or irrational, then i get lit. Additionally their homemade fettuccini breaks into small peaces right in the bowl, thats a no no for italian anywhere. Get it together.",neutral

"I've been getting my nails done (acrylic) for over 10 years now. I've always had issues with acrylic nails popping off because of the way my nail beds grow. (Apparently it's a thing - I've looked it up on google) I've been living in Vegas for a little over 2 years now and struggled finding a ""nail place"" that I could be loyal too.  Thank goodness I finally found ""my""  nail place. Monroe does my nails and she's wonderful. She always pays attention to detail and takes her time when she does my nails. She always does a perfect job so I'm officially loyal to the nail affair now.  Just a heads up... they're a bit on the pricey side ($55 for a full set) but imo it's worth the price because of the great quality and I don't have any issues with them.  However, the only reason I'm leaving 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the pedicure I received.   I ended up getting one of the more expensive pedicures ($50) and the girl who did my pedicure seemed lazy.

Mediocre food with no ambiance at all.  I decided on this place because I ran into a groupon and I still haven't learned my lesson  that sometimes there's a good reason to skip on a groupon deal because the food isn't great. The food here was ok. No bold flavors and it's not a spot I would likely visit again.   Mexican places should always have some authentic decor and the ambiance is key for me because the experience begin with your eyes. There's nothing of that nature here and the food pretty much went along with everything else. I ordered a hard chicken taco & a cheese enchilada which lacked in flavor and my mans mega burrito was a mega disappointment as well. Lots of food for sure but not traditional in any way.   The service was good so thank you for that but it needs some traditional decorations and a chef who knows about Mexican flavors.

"The wait staff is fantastic, and I really enjoyed my food. I had the Korean beef nachos (half order) and then 2 tacos (beef and chicken). The tacos were ok, but to be honest nothing spectacular. The nachos stole the show for me, and I enjoyed every aspect of them. They have the perfect combination of spicy, sweet, and crunchy. I will say that I bet a lot of people would want them spicier, but they were perfect for me.  The one drawback seems to be their drink selection.

"The food is what keeps me coming back - I've been here over 6 times now and every time, I pray the service is better. It never is. Sometimes I have had a reservation and other times not. Never seems to matter because they always want to kick you out after an hour and a half. Which is strange seeing that every time I have been there, there have been ample seating space. The hostess is so rude, it's almost comical. She isn't very smart, she's put off by the simplest questions. The waiters are just as bad. The service is lethargic and the pretentious but the food is great. You'd think whoever owns / manages this place would clue into to getting top of the line service. I could care less what the service's attire is as long as they are friendly and don't roll their eyes when you ask a simple question -- for example -- an extra friend was joinging us and we had a reservation for 4 - easy to put a chair at the end of our table. Hostess rolled her eyes. I couldn't believe it. You spend $250 on the bill -- you spend that kind of money not to be treated so horribly.",neutral

I ordered the corn-beef hash, which was quite good... actually saving the rating for this place a bit.  I could tell all the food was prepared well.  The service also saved the rating a bit.

"This is a good example of a Las Vegas original: A ""locals pub."" These are places to drink, eat, watch sports and gamble (sorry, I mean ""game"") all at once, or just do one or the other of the above...and either with groups of friends, a date, or just by yourself. Mulligans meets these expectations well with solid, consistent food and service. Seems to be a favorite with local law enforcement, since whenever we drive by, there's usually one or two police cars parked there (for the food, of course, as it's a safe neighborhood!)  Mulligans is not too much to look at on the outside, but inside you can either head left to the bar area or right to the restaurant area, both decorated in Southwestern style, with cool movie posters and Western memorabilia on the walls and TV's to watch Sunday football on. In our visits, we've only been to the restaurant side, but people on the bar side look like they're having fun watching sports and playing video poker.  What you look for in a locals pub in terms of food is what you get at Mulligans- standard bar food with your typical appetizers, hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta and breakfast items with a couple of cool twists (try the breakfast burrito or the Cobb salad to see what I mean.) Plus, if you are like me, the type of person who needs hash browns, not ""breakfast potatoes"" with your eggs and bacon, they've got that here, unlike some other locals pubs. We've been there for breakfast and lunch and there are various specials (both food and drink) depending on when you are there. But even at full price, it won't break the bank.  Being a locals pub, you can expect mostly good service with the occasional off-day- once when we were there, the waitress took forever to notice us and took a while to take our order and return with drinks...and then she got the order wrong. But the other times we've been, service has been good and the wait staff is definitely helpful and friendly.  Three stars rather than five because neither the menu nor beer selections are as broad as at other locals pubs and having been there a few times now, we've not had to really look hard to choose our favorite items, but for a place with consistent service and well-executed standard fare, it's a good place to have in your rotation.",neutral

"I like Fleming's. The food is very good with service and ambiance to match. However, our experience on Mothers' Day was disappointing. We had requested a table in the main dining room (for a party of seven.) When I found that we were being hustled to the closed off back room, I objected and we returned to the hostess stand. Mr. Jeff, one of several ""suits"" berated us for not accepting our assigned table.  He was anything but gracious. We were finally seated in the virtually empty main dining room. The menu was fairly new and the print is light and small (bring your glasses.) I looked for my Sunday favorite, the prime rib special but it was nowhere to be found. Our server, Jim said that they had removed it from the menu. Big mistake!! The next outrageous mistake is serving a choice grade of filet mignon rather than prime which everyone expects from a high end restaurant. You are paying for prime but are served choice. I can buy choice grade steak at any supermarket. I made some phone calls on Monday and found that while Morton's too serves choice filet mignon, Dominick's, Preston's and Mastro's serve the prime grade that you are paying for. Until Fleming's bring back the Sunday prime rib special and serves up a prime grade filet mignon, I will spend my hard earned money where I get what I paid for.",neutral

"It's a small place but makes for intimate and personal conversations. I liked the dim lighting as well as the light fixtures, quick service and reasonably priced drinks.   To drink I got a Bellini which was good (not the best I've had, but good). It came as a liquid and not a slush consistency which is what I'm used to from past experiences.   I will say that it you've come here for something to eat then go elsewhere as I don't think they have any food.   As for our bartender, he didn't do anything out of the ordinary to make our experience great--he just did his job and that was that.   Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again in the future.",neutral
"Located inside the Monte Carlo. Price was average for Vegas. Food was average and not nearly as many items offered, as other buffets. Not much service, as it took forever for someone to get us silverware. Even beverages are self service. The dining room area looked nice, with pillars and such, but once you sat in one of the booths, you sunk down deep. So request a table. While dining, suddenly smoke started pouring out of one of the kitchen/buffet serving areas. All the employees wondered what was happening, but no one went to check it out, to make sure everyone else was safe. We were finished by this time and headed out before smoke filled the dining rooms. Vegas has changed considerably over the years and the huge inexpensive buffets are nearly all gone. Your best bet here, is at breakfast.",neutral

"Rating: 3 1/2* The half of star is based on the service.   We came for lunch on a Monday afternoon after spending the morning at the zoo. It was a cold morning so we felt like something comforting to eat and this place was close. This restaurant is located in a plaza full of Chinese businesses. It was fairly busy with only one waitress working the front of the restaurant.   We were promptly seated and we ordered right away since we were hungry. My wife went with the Kimchi chigae, I went with the Jjamppong while my daughter went with the Spicy Pork Lunch Bento box. We also ordered a Donkatsu too.   The food was okay. Nothing exceptional but nothing overly wrong either. The best dish was the Kimchi chigae with the Jjamppong being the most disappointing one. The Jjamppong was sweet instead of being spicy with somewhat generous offer of seafood. However, there was no shrimp. The spicy pork had the same problem. It was sweet instead of being spicy.   Service was adequate along with the prices.   I'm still in search of a great Jjamppong in the GTA...  #26 of 2018",neutral

I also do my photo-finishing here and it's generally fine, though quite a few times I've picked up my negs and the scans have been covered in dust. Not the best quality, but these days unless you're going to a specialized spot, you kinda have to accept that.   The postal outlet upstairs, though, is always a disappointment. They normally just have one person on staff and sadly, their competence is spotty more often than not. There is always a line up of at least five people because it's so understaffed.

"God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco.   Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos.

Rumored to be popular during the weekend, a reservation thus made for 11:30am, it was precisely on time that I entered the front doors reading ""Welcome to my heart,"" a man named Michael greeting me with ""just a minute"" before wandering away for more than seven, much of it spent kibitzing with regulars as patrons both entering and exiting were forced to squeeze past me in the chilly, tight foyer.  Admittedly a bit annoyed when a young lady finally emerged from the back to seat me, Michael intentionally ignoring a stare from the door, it was with Coffee declined that water was filled and a menu presented, the one on the website completely identical and thus allowing for an expedited order.  Finding the kitchen far more efficient than front of house staff, the sleek and narrow space run by just two, it was only perhaps fifteen minutes after an order was placed that two plates were presented, the cast-iron skillet containing nine Meatballs still bubbling hot beneath melted Cheese and golden Eggs while the mixture of Sweet Potato and more traditional white dumplings were each pillow-soft amidst nuggets of Wild Boar Bacon, whole Walnuts and Maple-infused Butter plus Balsamic.  Eventually allowing the ping-pong ball-sized Meatballs enough time to cool, the majority smooth and rich though residual heat from the skillet had unfortunately rendered some a bit rubbery,  an accompanying laminated pastry was fairly well constructed and nicely paired to zesty Yuzu Marmalade with flavors a pleasant prelude to Tiramisu served in a flower pot with well-separated layers of creamy Mascarpone and sopping-wet Ladyfingers beneath crunchy Chocolate 'soil.'",neutral

"A group of 8 of us walked into here and looked at the menu on the wall, first in shock over the prices listed next to the dishes. However, we found out that these were family sized plates to share. After the shock subsided, we decided to sit down.  We knew we wanted a salad, so the waiter had suggested getting 2 salads because each salad would feed 2 or 3 people. We got the mixed green salad, two of them. As for the main, we all decided to share the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Rigatoni & Broccoli. Again, the waiter suggested we get a third main dish as he didn't think it would be enough for the 8 of us, but we held off this time.   When the salad came out, boy did we feel the waiter kind of misled us. The salad was HUGE, it probably could have fed 5 of us comfortably. I don't know if it has to be said, but there was plenty of salad uneaten by the end of the meal. The salad was average, I think the only reason I enjoyed it was because I was craving greens/vegetables. Again, when the two main dishes came out, we were really glad we hadn't ordered a third main as the waiter advised. These family sized dishes are no joke. Nothing memorable popped out for me for the mains, I was hungry and I was full after I ate, the dishes were neutral to me - they weren't particularly bad or good.   If you want a place to just eat a lot of blah tasting carbs, this is the place for you. However, there are a lot of other options in the area. Plus, the per glass wine costs were a bit steep. Plus, the waiter was not friendly at all. That is all.",neutral

I had the Hanger Steak as an entree, probably the best Hanger Steak I've ever had. But at $50, I wouldn't have minded settling for something at Mon Ami.  I finished with the White Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate Pearls. It reminded me alot of Mon Ami Gabi's.   The drinks were nice, but nothing special. I got the raspberry mojito which didn't have enough flavor and kick to it. The wine decent, but I paid $12-18 per glass!  Overall, it was good but not worth the price tag. I would definitely return to the original Joel Robuchon for dinner maybe to give the prix fixe a shot. But I think L'Atelier was overpriced for what you get.",neutral

I had the BBQ Burger which I ordered medium rare with half and half. The burger was cooked well and the onion rings were limp and tasteless. The fries were also limp, must have been sitting in the basket waiting to be served up. It too was tasteless until I added salt. The bacon was chewy and NOT crisp.

I really liked the homemade greek vinaigrette dressing, but the salad itself was kind of sad, limp, and randomly had uncooked cauliflower on it.   I would definitely want to return and try their breakfasts, but I am not sure that I would order dinner again as it was just ok.   The service was pretty good.

The coleslaw was very good.  My friend the roti with curry chicken.  The flavour was there, but there was a lot bones which is not traditionally roti.  That was disappointing.

"The free tickets thing is a sham and an advertising gimmick.  If you are going to go,  it's better to just pay for your seats.  The show is cheap and if that $10 breaks the bank maybe you should just skip it.   If you do want the free tickets,  book LONG in advance ... like before you leave home for Vegas.  The thing that pissed me off was that we bought are tickets and didn't get assigned seats.   Why did I have to stand in a GA line up for this show?  I'd almost rather pick another show to be honest with you.  I disliked the forced pictures and thought the video trailer for the show was dumb - proving to me I should still stay seated in the theater and not walk out... pointless.   The show is cute - not really vegas quality but I still didn't know how things were done.  There were special guests that I quite enjoyed - it was almost like a variety show in a way.

"It was a meal of highs and lows.  This casual sit-down eatery had no shortage of Chicago memorabilia or senior citizen patrons.  It's like they're going head-to-head against NY54 Pizza over in Sun Lakes.  The mussels in red sauce were a FANTASTIC appetizer.  The spicy, garlicky (sp?)sauce was a great complement to the perfectly cooked mussels.  I wish I got the full pound instead of the half.  I also wish they served bread or even another bowl for the shells.  My wife's pasta fagioli was not nearly as appetizing.  It tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with a few noodles and cannellini beans thrown in.The house salad was standard, but at least it was fresh and crisp.  The vinagrette was a little tart for my taste.  We split a pizza.  The subtle notes of the crispy thin crust and tangy tomato sauce were solid, but they were totally overwhelmed by a thick layer of bland cheese.  Toppings were sparse.  The homemade tiramisu was good, but not great.  It was a little too whip creamy, and am I the only one who doesn't like chocolate sauce over tiramisu?  I want to savor the coffee flavor, not the Hershey's syrup.  In summary, I'd go back.  Anything in their tomato sauce is bound to be good, especially the spicy version.  Try the mussels.  Pass on the pizza and the pasta fagiole.",neutral

"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now and finally decided to just make the trip here and try it out. I had such great hopes for this place, but it just didn't really hit home for me. I got here around 12:30 on a Sunday and there weren't that many people so that for me was not a good sign. This place should've been packed.   The hostess sat us quickly, but sat us in the very back at a booth that was big enough for a family of 8 or 10 people!! Felt weird to be at such a large table when there were plenty of tables that were much smaller and a better fit for a party of just two people.   Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order. Our drinks came out very quickly. Since this was the first time we came here, our waitress gave us some time to look over the menu. About 15 minutes later she came back and took our order. We decided to try the Chicago 7 deep dish individual size which was $12.95. We have never had a deep dish pizza before so decided on a smaller size so not to waste if we didn't like it. Along with the pizza, we decided to share a half size Crispy buffalo chicken salad which cost $8.99.  Food took about 20 minutes to come out. The pizza was smaller than expected but more than we could finish. Not sure if it was just the toppings/type of pizza I got, but I wasn't all that thrilled about it. The pizza was bland, not much cheese, it was really watery so the crust was soggy and there were so many tomatoes on the top that I couldn't really even taste any of the other toppings. Not sure if this is how deep dish pizzas are supposed to be, but it was just not my cup of tea. Probably will never order this type of pizza again. On a better note, the salad was huge!! They kindly divided the half order between two plates before they brought them out to us so I thought that our waitress had misunderstood me and ordered us two half sizes. She told me that their salad sizes are very large. So glad I decided to only order a half size. The chicken was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of buffalo sauce on them. The lettuce was fresh and they gave us just the right amount of ranch dressing. The salad was delicious and made up for my dislike of the pizza.   Wish I could remember our waitress's name as she was super friendly and very informative. She had a great attitude and seemed happy to be helping her customers. She always had a smile on her face.   Wouldn't recommend this place for an intimate date as it was loud. Even though there weren't that many people there, it seemed so loud that I really couldn't hear myself think. Didn't help that the people in the booth beside us were talking loud and making a scene.",neutral

"I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.  Luckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go.",neutral

"Pullano's is a dirty little sports bar located in a run down strip mall. But, remember, looks can be deceiving.   The pizza and wings are some of the best on the westside as well as some of the cheapest. But what really matters is Pullano's happy hour.   They have free pizza in the bar until 6pm everyday. On a side note, the way the pizza is set out makes it pretty unsanitary but since it's free...  Their drink specials are also pretty good. I usually go for $2.50 margaritas because they are decent tasting and cheap! I'm pretty sure the beer is really cheap as well, but I don't have any experience with drinking beer there.   The bar isn't bad at all, but the reason I give Pullano's three stars is because they really overcharged us during happy hour. We decided that getting drunk and stumbling across the street for night class at ASU West would be a decent idea. We preceded to have three margaritas each plus a gin and tonic and a Long Island Iced Tea. When our bill came out only the gin and tonic reflected the happy hour pricing. We were pretty upset, but we didn't have time to argue because we had to get to class.   Despite this bad experience, we continue to frequent Pullano's because the food is delicious. The specials are fantastic, as well.",neutral

"The ""sister"" property to the Venetian, the Palazzo has many of the same amenities that you come to expect.   All rooms are suites. . . large sprawling rooms with 3 flat screen TV's, a separate sunken living room with a sofa sectional (doubles as a sleeper), desk and table, and a bed with tons of pillows and comfy linens.   My favorite feature? Don't laugh but they have motorized curtains that allow you to lay in bed and via remote control open the draperies and raise and lower the Roman shade. (yeah . . .sometimes it's the little things!)   Room service is expensive (what isn't in Vegas?) and when they have a large group in the hotel- wait times can be over an hour and a half so plan accordingly. On three of the mornings I was here- the wait time was over an hour and the woman on the phone actually tried to talk me out of ordering . . . .and that wait was for cold cereal and a pot of coffee . . nothing even needed to be cooked!   I know the goal of every hotel is to get you out of the room and into the casino but my wish was to have some basic amenities included. A coffee pot would have been nice so that I didn't have to pay $26 for a pot each morning or get my bed weary body up and down in the casino to wait in line for a cup of ""joe"". Also-they charge $12.95 for Internet which also makes me nuts.   Finally- I don't know if it was just ""off season"" or what- but service at the pool area is pretty non existent. Only one of the 4 days I was there was I able to find a server.   And just when I was settling in- the server came by to tell me it was ""last call"". At 4pm? I get that they wanted to close the pool- but there were plenty of people out there worthy of keeping the pool open at least until the sun went down.   The room rates are on par with other nice hotel in Vegas- (we had a group rate of around $188 but the normal price is usually around $250). Check your reservation before going so that you know which Tower your room is in (Venetian or Palazzo) for if you check in at the wrong Tower- you will have quite the hike to get to your room.   Hotels, for me, are all about the level of service you receive. The Palazzo, does okay as it is certainly functional- but the beauty of the hotel sets you up for a bit of a let down. After all- how could some place that look so nice, stumble in so many basic service areas?",neutral

I ordered the green tea Taiyaki with green tea and vanilla swirl custard on top. I also opted for the Nutella filling inside of the Taiyaki. When I received my Taiyaki, I didn't expect it to be so small! They look so much bigger on the Gram! Anyways, the Taiyaki itself was too cakey, almost like a cupcake, but a little more firm. Although it was small in size, there was no way I could finish it. It was too much to chew. The green tea and vanilla swirl custard was good... Super rich! It wasn't too sweet, which I liked. My sister ordered the taro Taiyaki and said that there wasn't much taro flavor. I probably wouldn't order the Taiyaki again, but I'm glad I tried it.  We also ordered a Vietnamese coffee and it tasted like a regular iced coffee. A little disappointed, but hey, they specialize in desserts, not coffee.  The staff was extremely friendly and offered to let us sample the different flavors of Italian ice with no hesitation! I'll have to come back and give Recess another go...

We also hit the batting cages.  The helmets were probably 10 years old but hitting the balls was a good time.  If they make some improvements we will definetely be going back.",neutral

"I was in the neighborhood and looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch.   The good thing about this place is that they have a drive thru. Definitely a plus. I ordered the pollo verde burrito, minus the beans. The service was fast and my burrito was ready quickly. I liked that it was wrapped in foil, which makes it easier to east on the go.  The flavors were pretty good. I enjoyed the chile verde quite a bit. The flavors didn't blow me away, but it was tasty. I will definitely be back to try out the other burrito options that are also cheaper. The price added up pretty quickly, so $9 for lunch seemed a little steep. I saw some other burritos priced at just under $5, so I'll probably aim for one of those next time.   Definitely a good option for a quick bite on the go.",neutral

As one of my co-workers stated, it was just plain spicy but the flavors or lack there of leave much to be desired. The portions where huge, I give them that, but we each paid about $17 bucks for an order of flavorless chicken tikka masala  and vegetable byriany. We just expected the food to be homey, aromatic, and flavorful and sadly we did not find any of that in the food we received.",neutral

"Checked in earlier today. The young woman at the desk, yesenia, deserves five stars. She was great. Polite, friendly, outgoing, professional, all the things customer service should be. I wanted to say that first. I might bump up a star just for her service. Now on to the rest of the hotel.  I'm an IHG rewards member and travel frequently. I like to try all different hotels in the IHG family, but tend to stray away from Holiday Inn. But the wife and I didn't feel like staying home or leaving town, and Holiday Inn is the only IHG in Surprise, so I booked a king room and off we went. This is a fairly new hotel and from the outside it looked nice and I had a pretty standard level of expectations. Check in went quick, but I always try to stay on the top floor (hate footsteps above me while I try to sleep) and couldn't, or I could, but the front desk clerk told me that's where the baseball team they house stays and it would be ""really loud"" uh...okay I guess. If they'll be loud next to me, won't they be loud above me? But fine, second floor it is. Not a big deal or a complaint, just kind of weird. The room itself is a pretty standard size for a hotel room but for a king bed the bed was particularly small and not very comfortable. The room had extremely visible wear on the scratched furniture and wall which is strange for a new hotel. We got a rather unappealing view as well. The room was warm but the A/C worked fine and the room was overall clean. Huge mirror in the bathroom, standard amenities. Oh, and the pool is TINY. Really small. And not well taken care of as other reviews have mentioned. However, it's close to everything there is to do in surprise including library, stadium, water park (public pool with a water slide), shops, etc. Overall, I wouldn't book the hotel again if I have the choice, but if I'm staying in Surprise I'd stay again solely out of loyalty to IHG.",neutral

REALLY !!  so since we waited already we didn't just walk out like others did that waited only to be told ""sorry we ran out"" that's when we noticed how dirty the tile floor was and then how black and nasty the carpet was. is this any indication of how they clean the rest of the place. sure all the tvs are nice sure they apologized and even gave us a card for 12 wings but didn't help much. so ordered nachos, skins a sandwich w/fries expected larger portions for the prices fresh cut fries were not cooked enough the skins were really good and the nachos were average as well as the very tiny chicken sandwich that was like something from a cafeteria. no I would never tell someone to go to a place this filthy even if they have good food. if you like dirty bars that serve mediocre bar food then you hit the jackpot here. servers and staff were nice but not great. and my appetizers came out AFTER MY SANDWICH even though I asked for them to come out first as APPETIZERS. get it together people is it really that hard. sorry new day cle. but can you recommend a place that's not a hole or a dive. thanks",neutral

"Sweet Basil served a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese food.   The restaurant is nice and clean. The deco is simple but chic. The seatings is really comfortable.  However, I would not say this is authentic ethnic food. The spices are all toned down to suit the Canadian customers. We were there for lunch and we are the only oriental people there :).   Sweet Basil does have a good lunch menu ($5.99 - $7.99)! There are a lot of different choices. Even my vegetarian friend found something she enjoyed!  In light of the spirit of Pho-bruary I still stick to my Pho lunch. I ordered the Beef Pho in spicy tomato soup with vegetarian spring roll ($5.99) and my friend ordered the Thai Mango vegetarian combo with spring rolls/vegetarian hot and sour soup ($7.99).  The spring rolls are fresh and quite tasty. Ok I ate all 3 spring rolls because my friend does not like anything deep fried. So they must be quite tasty for me to eat them all :).  The hot and sour soup does have a lot of ingredients inside. However it is not Hot (not spicy hot or pipping hot). It is pretty thick in consistency but it is luke warm. I think it is lurk warm that's why it is thick.  I did request extra extra spicy for my Pho. However the broth comes out lukewarm. That does create a problem since the beef are served rare so they cannot be cooked proper in the warm broth. The broth is not hot (spicy or pipping). There are tons of fresh tomatoes inside and chives. The noodles is the dried type but it tasted ok. However, I would not order this again when I come back for another visit.  My friend's Thai Mango stir fried has pepper, mango, mushroom, carrots, baby corn, onion, dried tofu and water chestnut. She finished the whole thing! She said it tasted really good........  I am so glad that she enjoys her meal because sometimes it is so hard to din with vegetarian friend.  They accepts Mastercard.  I would come back to try out other lunch specials but it would not be eating Pho. And I would have to tell them XXXXXX spicy!",neutral

I don't know, maybe the chef forgot to throw in the other half of the noodles but I felt really ripped off with the portion we got - darn, should have taken a photo of it, forgot!

"After seeing the video of the jiggly bread from Japan, I was curious if this place was the same as the hype from Japan so my friends and I decided to stop by and check it out. After being open for about a year already, I guess the hype for this place has died down because there was no line when we arrived on a Friday afternoon. We just got 1 cheesecake for $10.  Note: there are two stores that are next to each other, this one only sells the regular flavor cheesecake while next door offers the green tea/matcha flavored baked goods. Choose wisely before you go to the respective store to order your food.  Like all the other posts, this description of this Japanese style cheesecake is pretty accurate by saying that is soft, fluffy, and eggy. From the look of it, you would not imagine how soft it is until you touch it or actually eat it. But in my opinion, it is way too eggy so if you do not like the eggy taste, then avoid!  It was a good experience to try but I do not think I would get it again, especially if there is a long line for it..",neutral

"For my fill of TexMex this is it.   I haven't been home since Xmas so I do miss, oh do I miss, El Chico's.   For OTB chips = 3.5 as they are served huge (the 1/2 of a tortilla style) and decent texture. No different that the Restaurant style in a bag from the grocery.  Salsa = 4.55. Why? It has bite. Spicy but not overwhelming. It showed me that I've been outside my LA heritage for quite some time as I am losing tolerance for the heat level. But it's cool~ I'll build up my palette again for this spice and Cajun spicy.   Service = 3. What I love: the chip and salsa guys drops his to do as soon as you sit. What I don't like....we were charged for tortilla's. So much for being new and not knowing anything because nothing was explained. But at least things were kind of prompt and not overly hovering.   Dinner = Ultimate Fajitas and that's a 4. To my surprise Shredded pork, zucchini, squash was included. It was almost as if we were having Hibachi but the veggies are cut thicker.   Specials = Yipppeee. Monday - Wednesday catch a deal.   They don't have Coke Freestyle here but seems like only one place in town even does. So, oh well.   The butter isn't real butter. It's margarine. I guess I've been spoiled by WIsconsin for so long that I forget butter may be a treat.

"I have to teeter between three and four stars on this one and tell you the short story is that the atmosphere is among the BEST so food almost doesn't matter. The decor is modern, beautiful and whimsical. The Food I tried was somewhat Basic and really was OK but was unlike the decor. (maybe I just wanted it to be a little fancier to wow me)  I thought the Kitchen not the servers seemed a bit out of sync to me on our visit here so  that helped influenced me to go with three stars.   This is a special destination place and is good for groups but  if you desire a private room for your group they must spend at least two thousand dollars. You also need to be aware That a three course dinner with a group of people takes about three hours.  I will say I don't agree with most of the reviewers saying the pricing is too high for what they got. I don't recall all the pricing but from what I remember  $24. for Jidori Chicken, $39. for Kolbe style hanger steak, $30 for Sea bass and $8 for ample sides are really what most places would charge.  I will say I didn't care about the parking because it was 118 degrees, I was all dressed up and didn't feel like walking threw the hot parking lot and we felt like valeting it but the valet was closed to people not staying over night in the casino.   While waiting for the group I was joining I decided to try a Negroni ($15.) Cocktail. It was made with all name brand stuff and was a double size. So I think it was a very fair price for a special old school cocktail that is one of Anthony Bourdain's last meal list. It's a very unique taste of bitter, sweet  but not too sweet and boldly strong in a good way and seemed kind of refreshing. They had live entertainment in the lounge and some people were dancing.   It was very dark in the restaurant and so you had to use your phone as a light to read the menu. Our group takes a very long time to decide so I do an Anthony Bourdain and decide to have another cocktail. I don't know how long it took but we arrived at 7 and I looked at my phone and saw it was 8:38 and we still didn't have appetizers yet. I was thinking that they'd come out with dinner but they didn't (Phew) and did arrive after some amount of time.   When my halibut arrived I found out it was dry and over cooked but the majority of meals that were served to our table were fine. The waiter asks me how it was and I was honest and said the halibut was very dry and over cooked but still edible and I didn't feel like sending it back. The waiter talked me out of feeling that way and said he'd have a new one for me shortly....and he DID! The new one was cooked just right so it was good. Nothing wrong with it just good sitting on some dried chili pineapple sauce. I did find out latter that the other person at my table with halibut also had dry halibut but didn't tell the waiter.   Over all I was happy and now know I also like Negroni Cocktails. Those cocktails are almost even healthy as the bitters in the drink are good for your liver and help contradict the gin.  The halibut was good but wasn't up there with a few others I had this year so that's why it's three star to me. I know everyone was happy and we would go back again.",neutral

Great course and very inexpensive. It is located right next to the phx zoo in the heart of the Papago mountains with $10-15 summer rates.   However. The customer service at this place in the golf shop is terrible. I've played here over 5 times now and i cant think of one good thing to say about the young lady working the later afternoons in the golf shop. I usually don't criticize on things like that but it's unacceptable and this course would definitely get 5 stars from me if they invested in a more qualified employee.,neutral

Just ok. Let down by the promising yelp reviews. Pizza was ok tasting but small I was able to eat a half by myself. For almost 20 bucks I want there to be leftover pizza. Mellow mushrooms pizza is much bigger and more flavorful the same price. Beer was expensive 3 bucks for a budweiser. The service should have been more organized for such a small place. Someone mentioned that they didn't know what the place was supposed to be I've cream parlor or pizza bar and that is true it's very odd. Nice decor and quaint. Most likely will go to mellow mushroom instead.,neutral

"I was introduced to this restaurant from a new friend - I know of this great secret Mexican restaurant hole in the wall youre going to love.  So after all that anticipation and making it there, I can tell you she was correct.  This is a great Mexican eatery that I would like!  Unfortunately not yet, I did not enjoy the juice bar.  When I ate there, I was unreasonably hungry that I ordered the most gigantic Torta I have ever seen.  The Del Rey.  Holy heart attack on a plate batman!  I imagine even weeks separated from that meal, that I am still suffering from that explosion of food that I consumed.  And it was so unbelievably delicious that I cannot imagine that I would like to find any justification to repeat that transgression again  So why the 3/5 mark.  I think a lot of the food is greasy.  I would really prefer more heart healthy food to give a rating of great / excellent.  But perhaps very authentic to Mexico.  And I also love that the food is a SUPER value.  That is HUGE.  I hated that I was served potato chips with the meal, but perhaps that is standard with a Torta?  And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place, surrounded by Mexican families, that probably like watching their version of football.",neutral

"I've had Belleria a few times during the summer and early fall and was thoroughly impressed with their NY style pizza. I have dined on location and also taken pizzas to go.  The servers are quick and friendly- no problems there. And, the pizza is pretty good. However, the last couple times have been less than satisfactory and all due to breakdowns in communication. The first issue was that sauce was left off of a NY style mushroom pizza that I added spinach to. Even then, it wasn't too shabby. The second, and most recent, incident included a few missteps. First was that banana peppers were put on the pizza instead of jalapeΓ±os, which I asked for. Second, I asked that there were no onions on my antipasto salad. Third, I found a piece of sausage on my mushroom and ""pepper"" pizza. Lastly, after taking a glance at the pizza at the counter I told the hostess that there were banana peppers on the pizza when the ticket so clearly said jalapeΓ±os. She literally said nothing to any effect of wanting to help and I ended up paying $25 for a pizza I didn't want and a salad that was laden with undesired onions.   Now, am I too good to eat some banana peppers? No. Was I gonna make a big deal about it and ask them to make it again? No. But, what I do expect is some type of accountability for that type of mistake. Maybe hook a sister up with a free 2 liter or take my name down and discount my next order.   Obviously, my issues at Belleria don't include the quality of the food or waitstaff but simply the lackluster attitude of the hostess, and thereby the business, for not emphasizing the value of their repeat customers by owning up to and fixing mistakes.",neutral

"K & K Specialty Tropical Fruit is a small fruit stand with fresh flavors not typically found outside of Asia, including one that ranks at the top of Andrew Zimmern's least favorite foods -- durian, a pulpy fruit that smells so bad that the store offers gloves to handle it. Unlike Andrew, my boyfriend and I ventured here only to find that the customer service was relly lacking. It was hard finding someone who spoke English, egich was fine but when we did they were not able to assist. We tried the pre cut durian which had no smell (not sure how fresh it was since it had been cut already). We really were hoping to try some exotic fruits but we did not. Overall, they have lots of exotic fruits and items to choose from. I think they would do a lot more business if they treated all customers like Andrew (lol), approach them and offer them some assistance. I find that we purchase more when we know the origins of something.  298 Spadina Avenue Toronto, Ontario M5T Canada",neutral

"So I was at work and my co-worker recommended that I try their poutine because it was a pretty big portion size and she said it tasted good.  I walked in and it was pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon, but then again I don't expect it to be busy during the day.  It was nicely decorated with chandeliers, paintings and had big comfy lounge chairs.  I ordered take-out and went with their ""Sweet Quebecer"" which is a poutine with sweet potato fries, gravy and cheese curds.  It was something different so I decided, why not?  It came to $9 and I waited about ten minutes for my food, which wasn't too long.  I got back to work and opened up the take-out container and I was mildly disappointed by the portion size.  It was much smaller than I had imagined for the price I paid.  Overall, the taste of the poutine was mediocre.  Nothing special even with the sweet potato fries.  I'd probably be better off going somewhere else and paying that much for a better tasting poutine.",neutral
"Met up with some friends for sushi last Sat night, they picked this place because it was close to the club they were heading too.  Our sever was Nori, she was amazing, very helpful and friendly.  One of my friends ordered a round of Sake for us, the Sake was warm with a powerful kick! My friend also wanted to do a Sake Bomb , but Red Sushi does not serve them, but if you know how set one up, you will find they have everything you need, so some did some Sake Bombs too.  Now I don't know if this is normal or not, but a friend and I showed up a little late to dinner and we still had in our hand our solo cup of booze, and never once did they tell us we had to get rid of it, maybe it because we were buying booze too. Who knows, but hey its Vegas baby!  Now is this the best sushi I have had? No, but is this the worst sushi I have had, no way. To start with I ordered some edamame; it was perfectly steamed and salted.  Then I ordered some California rolls, and you have the choice of having it either as a hand roll (looks like a sushi ice cream cone) or rolls, I went with rolls , it was fresh and it was good, I also ordered a Poppin Rock Sushi Roll, it was spicy tuna, crabmeat & avocado, never for the life of me did I think it would have pink pop rocks on top of it, but damnit it did. It was a shock me too, I guess I should have figured it out with the name Poppin Rock right? But after I got over the oh wow part, it was tasty, the mix of the flavors worked.   And for everything I ordered it ran me 28 bucks, now I had read the reviews and everyone said it was crazy expensive, but 28 sounds about right for me, everything I ordered tasted good and was fresh.  Would I come back again, sure why not?  Would I go for the Poppin Rock again, well probably not haha.",neutral

"My fiance and I were excited to see a dumpling restaurant open in the area! I'm in love with soup dumplings. And China Mama down the street does a pretty good job of it. It's no 626, but its still good.  They have their own parking lot. Plus!   But first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.  The menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.  When we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup.   The patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.  The hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour.   The soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one.   The menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!  Overall.. 626 dumplings beats NY dumplings beats China Mama beats Dumpling King",neutral

"If you couldn't get in to crowded CafΓ© Mediterranean, you probably wound up at one of its sister locations; this one is located two buildings down. Similar atmospheres, similar food and drink menus, prices are about the same. Although, for the summer, La Brava offers sheesha (shisha? It's not an English word, so spelling varies) for $9.95, but expect to spend a minimum of around $15, since you can't sit down without ordering a drink (water doesn't count), and drinks start at $4.50.   It's not bad, even though the waitress struck an attitude when we wanted to sit in one of the corner seats, rather than the crowded middle section she was trying to jam us in to. She dropped it when we told her we were going to be joined by a couple. Service here is slow, despite getting served by 3 different people; don't expect to get refills (paid or otherwise), and fully expect to ask for your glass of water 2x.   Sheesha flavors vary, I usually opt for the mango or berry flavors, but they were out of pomegranate for the night and the coconut sounded good. I wasn't disappointed. There's no alcohol here, but you can get either tea, juice or a virgin cocktail. What I do appreciate about the service is that they don't rush you out the door, so you can sit and relax with friends and talk in to the wee hours without someone side-eyeing you for copping your squat and only ordering one drink.  Hey, I would've ordered another if I had been asked by the server. :)",neutral

"This was my husband's second visit and my first to Dragon Palace.  The first time my husband went he came home excited about having a good Chinese place so close to us (and let me clarify that we are both American born Chinese so we love greasy Chinese food).    I love that right after we sit down they bring the tea, and there's no extra charge like a lot of Chinese restaurants these days.  This place does offer a great deal for a LOT of food -- we went with the Family Dinner special which was 11.95 a person for soup, eggroll, fried wontons, pork chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.  By the time the entrees came around we were totally full and we ended up taking three full cartons of food home.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.    However, I thought that the food here was very difficult to eat.  The chow mein especially was really, really salty.  I never ever send food back but we had to ask for them to cook it again because it was so salty, and it wasn't much better after that.  The sweet and sour pork was deep fried pork with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over it -- not even coated evenly.  The meat itself was tough and chewy in texture.  The fried rice was decent, nothing extraordinary.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert, they make these fried bananas wrapped in wontons that are coated with honey and they are delicious!  Since my husband had such a positive experience the first time he went, I am willing to give this place another try.  Maybe they just hired a new chef (our server said that he was also brand new) so there may be some inconsistencies in the menu.",neutral

Then as I asked her about a matte liquid lip, she points to a few brands and nothing else. I've come to other Sephora's where they help me really find my shade and walk with me through this process. But this girl made me feel like she was tossing me aside so she could go talk with a different employee the rest of the time.

"It is to bad that Sin City brewing does not have a location other than a little alcove off the Miracle Mile shopping walk.  They brew some really good beer, and have room for about 15 people to enjoy it. Their beer is four or five star worthy and with a nice location similar to the Gordon Biersch brewery on Paradise they would be one of ""the places"" in Las Vegas.   Perhaps they just want to do beer and not bother with all the food and other requirements of a big establishment.  The day my son and I stoped by we had a chance to visit with the brewmaster and he made it a totally worthwhile visit.  The beer is great .......  the location ? not so.",neutral
"The service was outstanding; I appreciated the staff members, who were clearly well trained, and must be treated well enough to be content with their work. Kudos to them, and the management.  The food was somewhat disappointing - not terrible, but not great either. I had roasted Brussels sprouts, which were fine, and calamari, which was brought to the table just warm (deep-fried foods should always be piping hot), and dressed in an overwhelming sauce - not the subtle sort of flavoring or careful preparation I hoped for.   Additionally, it was very loud in the dining room. Our server stated that it was due to all the windows being closed. The view of the fountains is a nice feature of the place. Perhaps it is a place to visit in the summer.   Finally, I question the $$ rating - it at least borders on, if not qualifies for, $$$.",neutral

I would have only given this place 2 stars...but when an area is starved for decent places to eat as Strongsville is, I can't be picky.  Food options in the area are very poor..but at least that had a very average Chipolte.  Would I return? Yes due to the li tied options.

He told me to turn off my air conditioner and someone would be out by 9.  At 8:30am, I got a phone call from one of the rudest people I can remember speaking to. He asked if I had called other places. I said, 'No, I didn't know that I was supposed to.' At that point he got so argumentative with me, and every question he asked he got angrier at my responses. I cancelled the service. No way would I recommend that repairman.

"Change is bad. Everyone knows it. You know it. I know it. Fish know it, plants know it, your boss lies to you, but he/she knows it too.  I was at Taro's today for what is surely the best non high-end restaurant sushi in Canada and they have removed the counters, stools and seats to force people not to eat there. Since everyone knows take-out sushi is as nice and palatable as three-day old cake it seems this will be my last visit to Taro's. I am not sure why they dislike and disdain the customers who took advantage of their seats and counters, because clearly putting bags of rice on the counter and taking away the chairs means you did not really need the space, but made sure you fill it with something else on purpose, but that is a loss to the customer and the business. The sushi menu is still there, but only amateurs or people who live next door (!?!?!) will buy sushi there now. So they have the sushi but want to send it out of the store only. Sorry, cold sushi sitting in the car for an hour is as cool as a SUV or four-door Porsche. Ladies automatically know that stuff.  The store is still selling packaged and whole fish, Japanese edibles and garnish of course. For those who do not enjoy standing in line Mr. Taro also now sells Japanese cheesecake and matcha cake too (see they are uptown but they know business and how to make money on the back of a trend), but gone is the ability to order rolls, sushi, sashimi, clams and even tempura and enjoy it there.  It is too bad because I always picked up something there whenever I visited. Whether fish, ready-made food, oden (which they don't care any more) or soy sauce I will pick those things up elsewhere as well.  See, I told you, change is bad. That is why corporations and hypocrite types always have to repeat the lie that 'change is good' or 'change is for the better' or 'change is needed' etc. If it were true it would not needed constant preaching.   As I was getting in the car I noticed that the kabob place two doors down has an amber 'conditional pass' from the city. I clearly won't be eating there either...",neutral

We did ask for bread which was a disappointment. It was day old and room temperature. My husband ordered the French onion soup and ribeye. He enjoyed the soup. The steak was just ok.

"Zoozacrackers Deli inside the Wynn was the most feasible option for a dinner date before catching Le Reve because we only had 45 minutes to spare and Zoozacrackers is just a stone's throw away from the Wynn theater.   WYNN BURGER ($11): The entire meal is vegan. Literally the exact same menu option is offered at Society Cafe inside Encore for the same price, but with poorer presentation here (plastic cups instead of glass, etc.). This meal is the cheapest option on the menu because it comes with a chocolate milk shake and fries. Everything else on the menu is served a la carte. I asked for lettuce on my burger and they obliged. I happen to like the chocolate shake but my husband begged to differ. Smh. 3/5 PRO TIP: If you're going to order the Wynn burger, walk on over to Society Cafe for a way better experience!  ZOOZA BURGER ($15.49): Expensive for a burger, but my better half gave it his approval. It's pretty gigantic too, so at least you're getting your moneys worth. 4/5 FRIES ($3.99): Taste like Burger King fries (not necessarily a bad thing). 3/5  VIBE: Upscale Denny's minus the servers + counter service for ordering. I was surprised at how slammed this place was on a Sunday night at 9PM. It's connected to the Sportsbook.    SERVICE: It was near impossible to catch one of the servers for a refill. The option to go up to the registers and ask a cashier for a refill is an option but they were so busy tending to the never ending line of customers we didn't want to bother them. The Deli is pretty much self-serve.   Worth a Return Visit? Our grand total came to $37 and some change. I'm not planning on coming back, but if you're in a rush or are trying to keep your dining costs at a minimum while you're at the Wynn, Zoozacrackers Deli will do.

"I'm used to Ranch 99 back in Northern California, and this supermarket wasn't anything spectacular. This is a good place if you want seafood! All of the traffic was around that area. The food from the take-out section didn't look too good.  The market also has the bakery, peking duck, the flattened 1/2 duck, and roasted chicken.   There is also Hong Kong Express to-go food where you can order noodles, dim sum, congee, boba drinks, rice dishes, etc. It's right next to the take-out food.   The most interesting part of the supermarket was the selling of Chinese pancakes in front of the store. You can order mini pancakes with either a red bean, coconut, or custard filling. Each pancake is made to order and is $.50 each. I tried both the custard and red bean pancakes and it was pretty good! Cash only payment for the pancakes.

"My wife and I stopped in because we wanted something new. The staff was very friendly and greeted us right away as we walked in. Neither my wife or I are coffee people so we can't say anything about the coffee. What we can say is the baked chocolate croissant was DELICIOUS, buttery and flakey. Not being a coffee drinker, I went for the fruit smoothie. It could have used a little more smooth and a little less ie (ice), but it was still flavorful and tasty!!  But now for the not so delicious, we both went for the breakfast croissant sandwich. While there was nothing 'wrong' with the sandwich, it was more along the lines of a mass produced breakfast sandwich (burger king croissandwich) that had been heated up by chef Mike ( the Microwave oven, that I'm guessing gets used a lot??) and then pressed on a panini grill.  All in all, I would say if I'm in the are and the mood strikes me, I would stop in again, but I don't know if I would make this a destination stop.",neutral

But an up charge for cottage cheese??  I don't mind paying $10 for a burger if it's great and the atmosphere is enjoyable... But Not the case here. The cottage cheese was listed as one of the side options, so makes no sense that there was an extra $1 charge!

We followed the pathways, which are clearly marked for the event, and only deviated once when Mark H. had to purchase a coffee. Actually, that place was definitely on the designated pathways. I also believe the gift shop was too.   Thumbs up for the ability to purchase the tickets online and then just showing the tickets on my phone! No paper wasted, just the green paper for admission.

"3.5 stars.  This is a really cute cafe that opened up a few months ago on finch. And when I kept seeing pictures of their matcha drink with macarons on IG, I really wanted to try.  Because the seating are limited (four small round tables and one long table), it may be hard to find a seat. I noticed a group of ε―δΊδ»£ (2nd gen rich mainland) taking up the table beside them to put their stupid designer bags! Like are you kidding me? What happens when there are customers coming who want a seat? My friend and I sat at the first table by the door. And because the Hello Gorgeous sign was in front of us, these group of girls were legit taking up our space to snap a thousand pics which made us feel uncomfortable because they were all up on us! So eventually we had to move. So annoying.   Anyway, the drink itself I will tell you now it's okay. It's basically an ice matcha topped off with cream and macarons. But for 7.50(?) I'd rather order another drink next time.",neutral

Probably never have had to chew so hard on ribs, and I've eaten a lot of ribs. Sauce was good but come on. Your name is bourbon and bones, cook your ribs longer. My husband got the veal chop and Brussels sprouts. Not tender or juicy. Another over priced scottsdale restaurant that does not deliver.

"Came here around 2:30pm on a Saturday and thankfully it wasn't too busy. I was super hyped to try their fried chicken, based on all of the positive reviews, but in the end, I was underwhelmed. We had the 5 piece chicken order ($15), that came with 3 drumsticks and 2 thighs, as well as an order of the kimchi cheese fries. Our order took about 10 minutes to arrive, and everything arrived fresh and hot. While the chicken was super crispy, not oily, and juicy on the inside, it tasted overwhelmingly of maple and was missing the spicy kick I was expecting. Maybe there just wasn't enough of the spicy sauce?  The kimchi cheese fries were seasoned really well and the first few bites were great, until we got to the middle layer and realized there was no more gochujang mayo/kimchi/cheese for the rest of the fries. The remaining portion of fries was dry and we were sad that we had paid $7 for non-existent seasonings.  Probably would not return.",neutral

"Re-review after ownership change - honestly the food hasn't changed much, so it's still a tough place to review because of hit-or-miss dishes and service. Probably a 3.5* and maybe a bit harsh rounding down, but I just can't justify rounding up given the negatives.  Thai Thai does get the basics right; generally, the flavors are authentic Thai and they handle the spiciness well if you so request (you have to ask for super spicy - i.e., off the charts - if you want authentic levels of spiciness).  And frankly, some of the dishes are amazing. Their crab meat fried rice is one of the best fried rice dishes I've had anywhere, and I do love my fried rice. I also love their roast duck curry, wonton soup, tamarind duck, and basil anything. I also usually round off the ordering with a green curry or panang dish, both of which I find satisfactory.  So unfortunately, the bad:   The fish quality here is just really suspect. For example, there's been twice now that we've gotten the salmon panang and it was just obviously not good or fresh salmon - the texture and flavor were just so off. Even when it's more edible, it's still not great fish.  Also, service is usually friendly but it can be very slow especially if there are lots of tables seated. I have waited 30+ mins at lunch even when it's not that full so may not be the best choice if you have a limited lunch break.  All in all, this place will satisfy my Thai fix as long as I stick to the stuff they do well - and I'm pretty glad to have it around if only because there aren't many other Thai options on this side of town.",neutral

Don't ruin it for the rest of us who like all beer ice cold.  The other day, I was hungry and ordered food.  Pretty sure the food I had was heated in a microwave.

"U of T Health Service is great...IF you know how to work the system. Hopefully I can provide some insight on how to navigate the health service with minimal pain.  FIRST appointment: is extremely difficult to make. Your best bet is to make one in person. Line up in the never-moving queue and register your student ID with Health Service. Ask for online registration, so that you never have to deal with them in person again.  If you call them, you will be put on hold for 10 minutes, and then the line will hang up on you. You will call them again, you will be put on hold for 10 minutes, and then the line will hang up on you. Lather, rinse, repeat, until a receptionist deigns your call worthy to answer.  SUBSEQUENT appointments: 15 minute (most) appts can be made online. Pick your doctor, pick your availability. If you need a longer appointment (first time birth control, STI tests, annual checkups), see ""first appointment"".  WHEN YOU ARRIVE at your appointment: Don't bother lining up in the never-moving queue. Just swipe your card at the self-check in and wait for the nurse to call.  DROP INs: Don't really exist. They're more like same-day appts. Visit the clinic as early in the day as possible. If you're lucky, they will give you a same-day appointment.  FLU SHOTS: Are super fast here and given by the nurses during designated flu shot clinic hours. However, make sure you ask for a fresh bandaid, because they peel the bandaids and stick them to the edge of various dirty tabletops to keep the super fast pace. Ew.  See? That was (reasonably) easy.",neutral

"After checking into our room, we were ready for a cocktail and decided to check this place out.  It was pretty early so most of the seating was open.  The hostess let us pick our seats so we headed over to the sofa in front of the beautiful fireplace.  The decor is very upscale and at the same time, library esque with lots of dark wood and a huge selection of books on the shelves. Our server came by and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu.  I decided on Let's Elope, a gin based drink with fresh melon and lime.  My husband ordered the Penicillin, a scotch based drink with ginger, lemon, honey.  My drink was refreshing and tasty, but I liked the Penicillin more probably because I love fresh ginger.  My husband wasn't sold on it.  We were having a nice time until two other patrons came in and sat in an area next to us and smoked nonstop.  Yes, I know it's Vegas, get used to it, but all that second hand smoke was a making a direct beeline to me.  Not only does it irritate me to breathe it in, but I hate when it permeates my hair and I end up smelling like the one with a nasty habit.  So we decided to move to some seats across the way near the bookshelves.  This was a good move, because now we had access to the books, and they were genuinely interesting books.  We started to look through some of them, and then those two smokers moved to the area we just left in front of the fireplace.  And of course, their second hand smoke once again headed straight for me.  Ugh!  I swear I must be a magnet for that crap.  So we had to leave.  If it were not for the two annoying smokers, we might have ordered more drinks.  And that's really the only reason for 3 stars.",neutral

I ordered the Spider Crab Spring Roll (Goi Cuon Cua Lot), Fried Chicken Dumplings (Ha Cao Chien), and the Ramen Noodle Pho. The softshell crab was my favorite, felt really fresh and healthy. The ramen pho was also good, but nothing special. I was kinda disappointed over the dumplings, the consistency of the chicken was a bit bland and the overall dumpling was doughy. Finally, the price was kinda steep. Therefore I give the whole experience 3-stars.    Although the food wasn't great, I would come back to one of their nightly events.

"REI has always been a store that has quality items.  In Berkeley I enjoyed the exploring the large store, that had everything.  In Seattle tis easy to get lost in the three stories, and in Portland tis in the Pearl District, and they are far larger than the small stores in Las Vegas.  I have used REI, as my Bicycle shop because of the knowledge of the mechanics.  I have taken the road bike classes every other year as refreshers in the early months of the year.  I seem to always be on my bicycle on Saturday or Sunday ride when passing close to REI, with its easy to reach location in the District at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson, NV (South west of Green Valley & 215 intersection).  The Bicycle Shop has always been wonderful to stop for parts or upgrades, but recently there are few qualified mechanics.  There are helpful staff that can sell your items, but no one with knowledge on what you need, or will it work on my bicycle with this crankset?  I still do not have a chain catcher installed, on all my bicycles.  Seems the store needs to hire more qualified staff to replace the staff that has moved along.  For my bicycle needs I have gone to a competitor, as the one mechanic left can not be there all day long 7 days a week.  The last three times i needed repair there was no one qualified was scheduled in the bicycle shop for hours.  Maybe this will change soon, but February and March 2013 it has been a waste of time for me, and my bicycles.    I can only hope this is a temporary condition for this easy to reach location improves rapidly,.  JR",neutral

"Solid 3-star. Could be so much better, but ""A-OK"" for what it is. There are three sections: Asian, Dessert and regular Buffet-style.   Asian section had a small selection of sushi (which I didn't try), various hot items like pot stickers, pork buns, etc., fried and steamed rice, various noodle dishes, typical chinese items like beef w/veggie and Gen'l Chang's chicken. Large section of build-your-own-soup where you select the items you want in your soup and give it to someone (I didn't try this, either) to make the soup for you. A lot of people were getting this, so I'm guessing it's decent. Of the items from this section that I had the pork buns were mostly bun and very little pork .. but the pork that was in there was good. Pan fried dumplings were fine as were samosas.   In the regular buffet section, the prime rib was a bit disappointing. Not enough flavor. The fried chicken looked pretty good, but I didn't go back for it. Mashed potatoes w/gravy were good as was the mac & cheese (although it needed to have richer flavor, IMO). There were a lot of choices, but I wasn't in the mood for most of them, so I passed.   See .. I needed to save room for dessert. The dessert section is in the middle, so as I went to check out the Asian section, I saw what was waiting there and I knew I would not want to miss dessert.   Pineapple upside down cake? Ok. Chocolate fountain with marshmallows, macaroons and fruit for dipping? Certainly! Cotton damn candy .. wrapped? I'll take one to go. thankyouverymuch.  Sure.

"No noodles in their Chow Mein dish. Not a single one.  I ordered lunch for myself and 6 other employees through Bitesquad for a lunch meeting. Two of the seven members ordered chow mein, and neither person received any noodles at all. One order was spicy beef chow mein, and the other was a vegetable chow mein. One bowl was literally just vegetables, and the other was beef in a bowl full of vegetables. The member who received the bowl full of vegetables went and bought lunch elsewhere. The only reason we even ordered from Autumn Court is because she was craving noodles and we saw that Autumn Court had a very large selection of noodle dishes.    I give three stars because the members whose orders were not incorrect said it was very delicious, and I believe that this could have been a one time accident. The crab puffs were crispy and seasoned well, and the potstickers were large and meaty. The member who ordered the Dan Dan noodles said they were very flavorful and had nice texture, and even the noodle-less Spicy Beef Chow Mein dish tasted good, although it would be more in line with a spicy beef and vegetable dish. Also, the order was made perfectly on time.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant for takeout, but I suppose if you eat at the actual restaurant you can ensure mistakes like missing noodles in a Chow Mein dish do not occur.",neutral

"Lovely little cafe right at Yonge and Sheppard with an entrance linking to Yonge/Sheppard station on the TTC so it's really easy to get to it. FYI even though it's called a cafe, there's no seating area to enjoy your desserts. It's mainly a take-out place.  I tried their matcha tiramisu (a new-ish addition to their menu) and sakura cheesecake.  I love all things matcha, so I obviously chose the matcha flavour when I wanted to try their new tiramisus. The matcha flavour is very rich and strong, and the tiramisu itself was so creamy. Loved it.  The sakura cheesecake was very interesting. There is a layer of jelly at the top with some sakura petals embedded in it for a beautiful aesthetic. It has a very light floral flavour, and very lovely.   If I'm in the area again, I will definitely stop by and pick up some desserts.",neutral

"While not my first place to go for middle eastern fare, it is a place to keep in the rotation.  Tempe has no shortage of Middle Eastern food and this is one of the good ones.  The staff is very friendly, the food comes out quick and is quite tasty.  Better yet, it is less than 1/4 mile from my house.    I know many people recommend the lentil soup, which I tried based on the recommendations and I thoroughly enjoy.  They use red lentils rather than the green (?) lentils that seem more common.  In my experience, red ones are more mild and more delicate.  I don't recall what entrees we got but it was tasty.  The only issue I had with this place once is that they randomly close early.  It could have been a single occurrence but I called to see if they were open after 8p, and he said no.  Then when I went in a few weeks later their hours say they close at 9p.  I have no problem with people closing when they aren't busy, but I would suggest making a phone call to check if they are open if you plan on going later in the evening.",neutral

"This place is deece--if you can get a table and deal with nightmarish Scottsdale crowds.  We tried to check Stone and Vine on what we thought was early a few Fridays ago. At 6:00 there was a 45 minute wait and the area around the bar was PACKED. Like, can't move. It looked like a country club convention threw up all over it. WINE WINE WINE, and middle-agers chugging it! It was kind of comical, but we didn't really feel like waiting in standing-room only for that long.  So I made a reservation last week and tried again. We were sat in the very back by the kitchen, but whatevs. Maybe they want women clad in rhinestone-adorned back jean pockets to walk in and see only familiar faces.   Service took a while, but I think it's because our gal was overwhelmed. I saw her party of 7 beckon her over to take their orders once she came by for our drink orders. And it took a while to get from the bar for drinks back to our table, roughly half a mile away.  The good though, was the food. The pizza was spectacular! I'm not sure how they made it so crispy/charred underneath and fluffy inside?! It boasted an garlicky olive oil base, covered in housemade fresh mozz, tomato, spinach and a sprinkling of ricotta, which I'll sub out for feta if I get it next time. Just needed a little flavor contrast.  Boyfran had the meatball panini, which he dubbed one of the best of all time. The salads we started with were amazeballs. Lots of veggies and fresh shaved parmesan on top.  We'll be back, but only with a reso and only to laugh at the crowd. Food this close to home cannot be beat.",neutral

My only complaint is that the chicken gnocchi soup WAS MISSING THE GNOCCHI.  How are you going to serve me soup missing one of the key ingredients??? I don't know how this happened.

A few years I read a book, Positively 5th Street (which the author enters and does well at the world series of poker) where he raves about the food at Binions.  Anyways if you are in the mood for greasy food at good prices check out the Binion's cafe.  I ordered a grill cheese with ham.  What i ended up getting was like nothing I imagined.  I received a sandwich stuff with tons of super greasy ham and cheese (tons of greese!).  Despite the fact that it probably took a couple months off my life the meal wasn't bad.  I was a bit hung over so my body actually appreciated this meal.  Binion's to me is almost a historic site.  It's somewhat painful to see them move away the world series of poker, then shut down the hotel rooms....my hope is that the casino and food establishments aren't the next to go because that would indeed be a sad sad day....",neutral

"I would say that this hotel has some real highlights and some big misses as well.  Let's start with what is good--The M Lounge is great--they have soy milk available all the time--which I like.  Their breakfast is one of the best ever at Marriott Lounges--great omelette bar.  The lounge has a nice layout in terms of space and there is room to work--which is great because the rooms have no desks--very strange.  I travel mostly for business so a workspace is important to me.  They have good cardio equipment--hardly any strength training equipment though.  The hotel has been nicely refurbished and everything looks fresh.  Now the low lights....I checked in late due to delayed flights and when I got to the hotel I did not have an upgraded room--though I was told it was--it was just a standard room--and what's more the air conditioning did not work at all--no fan, no cool air--nothing.  WHen I called down I was told it would be over 30 minutes to get someone to come look at it--really??? it's nearly 1 am.  what exactly are they doing at that hour?  Any way, after much back and forth, I was given another room--actually a much better room, which I was told initially was not available--I guess if it's 1:30 in the morning and you were given a room with no AC---things suddenly just open up.  I am lifetime platinum elite with Marriott--why wouldn't someone have checked the room prior to my arrival to make sure everything was working?    Follow-thru is such a simple concept.  BTW yelpers--in many properties the fact that I am a lifetime platinum guest with Marriott makes no difference whatsoever, so don't be fooled by these hotel programs--most of the time they mean very little to nothing in terms of guest experience, with the exception of Hilton.  I am only gold status with them and they treat me like I am very special--every time I check in--and I get incredible rooms.  I would say that Hilton guest service for their premium guests is more evident than most Marriott hotels.    So I diverged--back to the Marriott in Calgary....I went to the restaurant for dinner--when traveling on business I want dinner in a timely manner and I like to receive the food as I ordered it--very simple expectations--neither was met at this hotel on Wednesday evening--I  ordered olives to start--the salmon with whipped potatoes instead of whatever came with it.  The olives came out pretty fast--I mean it was olives--how hard is that--then I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited--25 minutes, 35 minutes, 45 minutes--where, pray tell, is the salmon?  I found my waiter eventually and it was coming right now...and I waited and it showed up--not as I ordered it--there were no whipped potatoes as I had specifically requested.  Then I waited and waited and the waiter shows up with boiled potatoes sort of smashed with milk--then he explains these are their mashed potatoes--however, I ordered the whipped potatoes--which by the way never came.  Anyway I had waited so long, I just had the meal packed up to go--no whipped potatoes. How hard is it to take a single dinner order and serve a meal in a timely fashion, correctly--apparently impossible--because it did not happen.  The waiter explained to me that that he had just forgotten about me because he was busy with a larger party and he was new--here is a clue for you Daniel--sometimes business travelers are there by themselves because they are working, and they want a meal.  I was then told it took such a long time for my meal because I ordered an appetizer--it was olives--you don't cook them--you put them in a container and deliver them to the table--people eat a few and then they want their meal--what in the world would make you think it would take me nearly an hour to eat 4 olives???? This property underperforms its potential in terms of service, but it is a good location, and the room was clean, and it has a good lounge.",neutral

"A perfectly nice dining experience.  Service is good and the decor of the restaurant is chic and warm at the same time.  But the quality of the food (even though decent) just doesn't match the prices.  It's the kind of place to go if you want to impress your date with ambiance, rather than dive into authentic Indian cuisine.  We had the Winterlicious menu and it was quite tasty.  No complaints, just nothing really stood out as terrific.  My husband had the pakoras and I had the butternut squash soup.  His app was quite small (two pakoras sitting on top of some slaw) and mediocre.  Nothing like the crispy, oniony, fragrant morsels I've had at other places (ahem...Banjara).  My soup was quite good, though.  It had a great spicy kick to it and was rich with flavour.  Decent portion, too.    Our mains were also good, but oddly portioned.  I ordered the butter chicken.  If I wasn't pregnant and craving sugar right now, I'd probably complain that it was too sweet, but frankly I lapped it up.  My husbands vegetarian Buddha meal was three times the size of my butter chicken for the same price.  Chana Masala, Dahl Mahkenhi and Saag Paneer all in individual serving dishes.  Each dish was good - although VERY heavy on the cream - but we thought it was odd that the portion sizes were so different.  Dessert was a total disappointment.  My rice pudding was like rice-based oatmeal.  Goopy and unappealing.  And it's garnish was a compote made with dried cranberries, which seemed like a decision to cut costs.  I ate two spoonfuls and left the rest.  My husband's dessert, a haagen-dazs bar was...well...a little haagen-dazs bar on a plate.  Cute.  But can't give the restaurant much credit for that one.  There are so many great Indian places in this city.  Keep exploring, I say.    Vegetarian score: 7/10 - fewer choices than at most Indian restaurants because the menu is smaller than most (because it's ""fusion""?)  But you'll have no difficulty getting a satisfying meal and some choice.",neutral

"Went there with a client/friend the other evening.   It was rather noisy and busy and he thought we'd go somewhere else if we wanted to hold a conversation and actually hear each other.  After visiting the nearby Sprouts and doing a little shopping, he decided, nahhh.   Let's go to Babbo after all.  I was starving, so that was fine with me.   First I had to check out the bar menu.   What??  Tito's martini, $9??   I am so there!  Told the server how I wanted it:   shaken with ice, no vermouth, in a martini glass.   Perfecto!   As we perused the menu, we snacked on the warm bread (Yes, bread.  Remember?   I was starving!!) dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  We both ordered the Pomodoro Tomato.   I thought it was some kind of salad, like with lettuce, but I was informed, no, it was a tomato with mozzarella cheese, just like the menu says, with virgin oil, sea salt, and basil.  Huhhh?   He's Italian.   Therefore, he explained it to me.   Yummmmm!!   I wouldn't mind making that myself.   In fact, I think I shall for the next luncheon or dinner party I have.    I had the Great White Buffalo and he had the Babbo's Bowl O' Bolognese.   My pasta came with two big pieces of chicken.  Very creamy and tasty with the Gorgonzola Sauce.   It seemed rather paste like, as though there was maybe flour used.   I think it could have done away with that, albeit it was good.  Even though he professed not to be hungry, he did down his Bolognese and pronounced it to be very good.   I guess he was hungrier than he thought.  I would go back.   It is conveniently located.  The drink prices were perfect.   The service was friendly and accommodating.",neutral

"The Flamingo: it's a fine place to crash. I stayed here in August on my first trip to Vegas, and I'd stay again. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  THE GOOD: Great location (middle of the Strip across from Caesar's), excellent pools. The GO Pool, the one for adults, is everything you'd want a fun party pool to be, and they have nice thick towels that are unusually luxe for pool towel service. The rooms are cute enough, distinctive in style-- they don't look like a Motel 6. The room and bathroom were clean, and I liked that the duvet cover was washable and gave the impression of being very clean. I loathe hotel bedspreads, so that was a plus. I was on the fourth floor and my room was very quiet over both nights, EXCEPT for the moment when a man ran around the floor at 3 AM screaming like he was being chased by demons. That woke me up. But what do you want? It's Vegas.  THE BAD: Ants in my room-- seriously. C'mon, guys. I was flicking them off everything I left on the table. The shower was almost unusable. It came at one pressure setting-- ""wake up a blackout drunk""-- and the shower curtain was very, very friendly with me. I eventually put it outside the tub for a couple minutes, and in that time the firehose pressure of the showerhead practically turned the bathroom floor into Lake Mead. This is a desert, guys-- ever heard of low-flow?  THE UGLY: No outlets anywhere near the bed. This is 2014. We all lie in bed and play with our phones before we fall asleep, and wake up to alarms we set on them. If you don't have an outlet within reach of the bed, your hotel is stuck in the 1990s. Period.  Side notes about management: very long line for check-in even at almost midnight. Staff is friendly, however. Didn't encounter one staffer who wasn't a pleasure to speak with.   If you want classy or luxurious, stay at the Wynn or Bellagio. If you have money and want fun, stay at Caesar's. But if you're mainly looking for a decent place to crash once your three-foot-long daiquiri cup runs dry, the Flamingo will do ya.",neutral

Students still flock here, corona's still flow freely and tacos are consumed by the thousands, but I prefer the old, dirty Dos to this new multi-level locale.  There was just something great about ditching class to go day-drink and eat at Dos.  One trip back to Dos was enough for me though.

"Interesting experience tonight. Been to many Landry's spots, and have always had a reasonably good time. With the exception of the uncomfortable bar stools, tonight was no exception... until I went to close out...   The nice bartender went to run both my credit and ""Select Club"" card, but their system was not working. After waiting a while, the bartender apologized and called over the manager. After waiting some more, the bartender asked the manager if he could buy me a drink to apologize for the long wait (keep in mind I had already bought two drinks one for $11 and one for $15) - not only did the manager refuse and look at the bartender like he was nuts right in front of me, but he never even acknowledged that I had been waiting at all. A few minutes later the manager gave up, and had the bartender close me out by hand (think carbon paper receipt where they write down all of your private credit card info and have you sign). Not once did the manager apologize for the wait, or even acknowledge the fact that I had been waiting at all; despite the fact that this whole attempt to ""fix the system"" occurred right in front of me on the other side of the bar. I have no problem with the fact their system was down, but disappointed this is the way the manager elected to handle the situation. I applaud the bartender for his efforts to correct the issue - his instincts were correct. The manager's service etiquette is another story... this is not what I would expect at Chili's, let alone McCormick and Schmick's... What started as a great meal, ended with a bad taste in my mouth.",neutral

It was over an hour for hummus, salad, and crackers!  We ended up returning it because we were moving to our services. We were told that we would have to pay for food separately.

"I'm writing this review whilst I sit at the desk of our junior suite on the 30th floor. It's coming up on midnight, and me and the gf just got out of the jetted tub where we'd been soaking in a hot bubble bath for almost two hours. Late-night munchies have hit us so we're thinking about ordering some room service. I see Southern fried-chicken and mash potatoes w/ gravy is available all night, yum. It's our last night here, so we're kinda desperate to make the most of what's left of our 4 night stay. President Obama is due to arrive in town around the time we'll be heading to the airport, so I asked the concierge to send our complimentary limo (a perk if you take advantage of the Prima Privilege Program) an hour earlier than originally planned. Would be nice to hang around to maybe catch a glimpse of the POTUS, but oh well.   It was a nice little vacation here at the Signature, although not a flawless experience. Our room greeted us with a slightly unpleasant odor (like someone got sick in the room some time ago) that was annoying enough for me to call housekeeping to bring a can of deodorizing spray. Help didn't come until after a third call to the front desk to explain the situation. Maybe because it was the 4th of July that they were slow to respond, but this kind of delay at such a highly-rated hotel makes for a somewhat disappointing experience. It must be noted that some minor trash was found under our bed, as well as a moist spot on the rug. Disconcerting stuff to say the least.  Well, after the initial bad feelings, I have to say that the staff at the Signature made the rest of our stay pleasant and comfortable. For example, we slept in on a couple days, preventing housekeeping from making their rounds. But a call to the concierge is all it took to get our room fully serviced while we were away at night. And the housekeeping staff is very transparent here, no apparent noise in the hallways early in the morning or even a sighting of a maid or cleaning cart. I don't know how they did it, but I am impressed.   The amount of walking required when staying at the Signature is considerable if you don't like to walk or are unable to be very mobile on foot. One good thing about staying at the Signature is that you're relatively close to the monorail that runs the length of the Strip - very convenient. If you're considering trying the Prima Card, make sure to ask the concierge to explain the program benefits in detail. We got the impression that some of the vendors associated with the program were not at all familiar with how it operates, and found ourselves having to explain the program more than a couple of times. Depending on how important the benefits and perks are to you, you may or may not be willing to front the $500 that the Prima Program requires.  I'm giving the Signature 3 stars, but it's really more like 3 and a half. Can't go as far as giving it a 4 because of the initial room issues and because the hotel is located just far enough away from the Strip to keep it from being ideally situated. Also, the pool was too crowded to go swimming in comfortably, while an adjacent pool intended for weekend use only remained vacant. But go ahead and give Signature a try - you might have better luck and have a 4 or 5 star experience. And if you find a good price online, it should definitely be one of the better deals in town.",neutral

"My husband and I stayed here for only one night. I don't know if we would choose to come back because we had mixed experiences.   First, at check in, the woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Then we went out and decided to splurge for the $30 valet service.... You get in and out privileges. The people out front were absolutely NO help. We asked 3 people where to get our car valeted and people just left us standing there looking like fools. When finally a young man gave us a ticket and said he'd take it from there.   Up to the room, we were on the 20th floor, and had an INCREDIBLE view of the fountain and bridges. The room was beautiful at face value. The room was VERY dusty, though.... Don't look under the bed. Sheets were scratchy. Yes, the room was a little snug but my husband and I are from Chicago and used to actual closets so it was just fine for us.   The thermostat wasn't working and where our room faced the sun was setting directly into the room making us super hot. So we went to the front desk and a different girl was rude to us and not informative at all - but eventually we got maintenance to our room. We also asked her where to get wine glasses and she responded ""uh... I don't know, room service?"" She didn't offer to help us in anyway. So back up to the room we called room service and the woman said ""we're already doing rounds, come to the bar and we'll give it to you"". For a hotel that charges upwards of $230 a night I would expect the hospitality to be on point.   We needed the car later, I called down from the room asking valet to pull the car up. When we went down 10 mins later we stood there waiting... I asked someone eventually if our car was on its way and the valet said with a shrug ""I dunno"" when I could clearly see my keys hanging on the board. Finally, someone grabbed the keys and took off to get my car. I should also mention they don't take care of your car. The stuff I left in my back seat were on the ground and some flipped over. What did they do with it? Anyway. Not worth $30, not worth a tip (even though I did)  Stay here for the view, not the hospitality.",neutral
Aux Vivres is a great spot- crowded- so we aren't the only ones who think so.  We needed something relatively healthy after many hours in the car travelling from the U.S. and this place definitely delivered in both taste and portion. The burgers are huge- HUGE- and really tasty. I had the Burger Aux Vivres- very veggy-y and tasted amazing. The handcut fries are a great touch as well as the homemade ketchup.   Really no drawback to this place- other than it's popular- so you might have to wait a bit before getting a seat. Absolutely would go back.,neutral

"Summary: simple takeout spot has some of the best chicken sandwiches and coco bread I've ever tried, but wait times can get long, and the other dishes are not as mouth-wateringly delicious  Top Must-Get: chicken sandwich Top Regret: jerk pork  Located right beside KFC and down the road from Popeye's - it says a lot that this small takeout place still gets lineups for its chicken. It's a cramped space - you sort of just bunch up in the best line you can make when it's busy, and then order at the window. It can be a long wait since it's a small shop, but during down times, it's fairly efficient.  Their chicken sandwich meat is stripped right off the leg of a chicken, and it is absurdly tender and tasty. I get it without the coleslaw so that nothing detracts from the juicy chicken taste, properly flavoured, as I bite into it. Delicious.  They also have superior coco bread than other local Jamaican places - it's got a tinge of sweetness that just tickles the tastebuds right, and it's noticably less dry than others.  However, their jerk pork is missing the same legendary calling of their chicken. I also think their patties are comparable to supermarket-bought ones, so they aren't necessarily amazing (although not bad either - I have had the patty in coco bread a few times!)  The other dishes are decent if not spectacular. I recall feeling a bit let down at their dinner portions: a hefty amount of rice, but not a proportionate amount of meat.  That said, it's worth a visit if only for their chicken sandwich.",neutral

"Not the best, but it does the trick.   I walk-in with sunglasses on, a hoodie pulled over my head, and a docile demeanor. Nope, I'm not trying to rob the place of money, just of it's delicious burritos and as many salsas as I can fit in my burrito bag.   Robertos is not the best Mexican food in Vegas. Hell, if might even be number twenty-two on my list of ""A-OK"" Mexican fast food places in the valley, but what this Robertos location does have that I love, as they say in real estate... location, location, location. I can pretty much walk here from my house. I came here after a raucous night at Yelp club night event that ended up going back to Henderson and resulted in me going to bed at 4am.   As I stare at the blurry menu, I zero-in on the Adobada Burrito. My main go-to when I need food meds to cure what ails me. If you haven't had Adobada Burrito it's basically chunks of slowly cooked pork in a red chile sauce, sometimes served with pineapples, and wrapped in tasty warm blanket of flattened bread, and paired with a guacamole/salsa mixture. This really is all you need, stop fussing about with rice and beans, pure filler! Stick with the basics, meat, veggies, and bread.   Anyone who doesn't think this place is fast food location is wrong. By the time I put in my order and walked over to the salsa counter, my burrito was already wrapped up and ready for consumption. That's pretty damn fast to me and under $6, sold.   BTW - The burrito was great and I took a nap immediately after. Food coma power down.",neutral

"I tried Rai Lay based on an intriguing article about it in a weekly, Charlotte events publication.  Although I'll give it another try, with friends, I was absolutely not impressed.  However, do not let my review discourage you from trying it out.  Rai Lay calls it's cuisine ""Thai Street Food,"" but from what I can tell, it has more sushi items than actual food you eat on the street in Thailand.  I've been to Thailand a few times, and sushi just isn't something I remember eating off the street.  I also don't remember eating edamame either, although Rai Lay's lunch dishes serve it as a complimentary side (like French Fries, I guess).  That would have been fine, but the edamame was so tough that it took both of my hands to squeeze the peas out.  And, the server tried to take my edamame away before I was even halfway finished trying to ply the peas away from the pods.  Just because it was a chore to eat didn't mean I wanted to give up on it.    In addition, I noted that a simple glass of house Chardonnay is a whopping $9!!  Yikes!    The article I read about Rai Lay characterized it as a place where servers explain the ""street food"" dishes with diners and work with diners on degrees of heat.  Not so during my experience.  I asked my server if the grilled pork salad was hot and spicy, and he said, ""I don't think so.""   I replied, ""Good, I'll take it if it isn't spicy.""  When the dish (which was actually quite pretty to look at) arrived, it had a full pepper jetting out from it, and it was littered with pepper flakes.  While the pork was really good, it was so hot that tears were rolling down my cheeks.  The star of the show (something you don't see in everyday Thai restaurants), is sticky rice served in a basket.  Granted, the rice was surrounded in plastic wrap to keep it piping hot (as opposed to a banana leaf), but the concept was nice and different.    The ""Thai Street Food"" concept seems like a gimmick to me in order to get people in the door.  It worked because I went.  But if the menu or the servers don't really indicate the difference between ""Thai Street Food"" and food from other Thai restaurants, then the gimmick could just as well be ""Free Parking.""  When I visited, it was at a time when only a few other diners were there, so there was no excuse for an experience which I expected would be educational but, instead, was just a little less than ordinary.",neutral

"So a group of about 10 of us girls were there last night for my girlfriends birthday dinner. Place was beautiful and didn't seem crowded when we got there around 7pm. At first our waiter was very nice and attentive but soon seemed extremely agitated. I get it, there was a lot of us and I can give people benefit of the doubt and I know he had other tables to attend to but I thought we were all pleasant toward him. Everyone ordered their food and received it except 3 of us. I waited patiently and then finally said something wondering where my steak plate was. They brought it out and I was shocked, it was small but surprisingly very good. Small strips of steak was placed on small rounds of purΓ©ed mashed potatoes and it was really good. Just as I had finished ANOTHER steak plate arrived that no one had ordered. Apparently the waiter asked for me to be served as soon as possible but somehow another order was put in for the same thing. I'm guessing they never even started mine and gave me someone else's order. They asked if I wanted it and I declined and then the waiter said ""looks like you liked it, couldn't hurt to have another one"". So I accepted it, assuming it would be free, with all the mistakes and me waiting much longer than anyone else. After two plates of $20 steak and potatoes I was full and satisfied. Price wise each dish should've been $10 for the amount of Food you get. I also got a cheese platter I think for $17 ish and for that price and what you get it is absolutely NOT worth it. I can't believe they overcharge so much for this. It should be $10 and even that is still too much.   Now my girlfriends actually had still never gotten one of the plates they ordered. I think it was lobster or crab or something. They asked multiple times when it was coming and they kept saying ""it was coming"". An hour and a half later this dish still had not arrived. Then finally our waiter says that they didn't have any lobster or crab left. Hm, what were they apparently making then? Finally, they asked for it to be taken off the bill. A few minutes later the same waiter we've had all night returns with the bill with my ""extra"" steak and their never arrived food on it. Oh and another girl thought hers was too spicy and needed that taken off the bill as well, which they failed to do as well. Oh did I mention a glass of wine is $16 at the lowest and a glass of Figi water WHICH WE NEVER ASKED FOR was $10 each??!!!! I'm appalled honestly at the prices. Also, since it's customary on parties over 8 (or is it 10 people?) you HAVE to tip 18%. Ridiculous and not worth it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because my steak dish was very yummy. Service was beyond slow as well. If we have to pay 18% tip they should have one waiter to only our table because he seemed way too distracted and upset with us. Oh and 15 mins before I knew we had to leave I said ""we have to leave by 9 so we need the bill. It didn't come til 25 mins later and was wrong. We didn't leave there til 9:40 because of the mistakes on our bill. Seriously, you need money, patience and a lot of time on your hands to deal with just getting food here.",neutral

"We have had dinner at Eno Vino on Junction Road many times in the past. It's our go-to place when folks come in from out of town, birthdays, and sometimes--just because. It's not the cheapest place, but if the food is good and one is treated well, it's worth it. And we've had many evenings there with servers who took great care of us. So imagine our surprise when we went recently for my birthday, and the service was just meh. I am a person who likes birthdays--mine and others. I had noted on the reservation that we were there for a birthday. I also told our server. She didn't remark on it more than ""oh."" I wasn't expecting a free anything, but a happy birthday or even a candle in our dessert would've been nice. Nothing, nada, zip. Our server was polite, but not warm. She was helpful in suggesting dishes but didn't check on us once they came, and it was not a busy night. In fact, I had to ask for a new fork at one point, while she was standing up next to the bar talking to the Asst. Manager. In addition, we ordered the pear tart for dessert, and she bought spoons to eat it with--the tart had a crust that one could not cut through easily with a spoon. We couldn't get her attention, so we just took forks from the table next to us that was set. So maybe this was an off night--that's what I'm hoping--but we may give them a little break for a while.",neutral

I was offered services from a prostitute a few times and she wouldn't stop so we ended up moving to the other side of the bar. I felt like I was turning down girl scout cookies because she was just as relentless as those little girls outside the grocery store. How polite can you be before it gets annoying... There were def. a mixture of people in there from grungy to dressed up. Most people we met were pretty cool. Only reason i'm rating so low is because cleanliness of the bar and bathroom.

"I've tried the Sushi Room twice using a Groupon. Even with the discount, the prices were fairly high for about average sushi.   California Roll - Average taste. They didn't cut the roll evenly, so your first might be a mouthful and your last could be scraps. This is tough when sharing.  Kappa Roll - I am very impressed by this roll. I've never had a cucumber wrapping on sushi, and it tastes delightful and refreshing. It's slippery and falls apart easily when using chop sticks, though.   Caterpillar Roll - It was just Ok. We came with a newbie sushi-eater and I was excited to have her try this one. It didn't impress like it has at other restaurants. They did arrange the roll in a clever ""S"" caterpillar formation.  Vegas Roll - Average.   One friend ordered the red Sangria that I sipped and liked. Light and simple.  The decor of the Sushi Room is cool. They've got some interesting fixtures, a relatively ornate aquarium, and a patio that blends nicely with an open wall. The ""Living Room"" next door is a neat looking lounge with similar architecture. We all remarked that these buildings had a classy, almost European look.  Overall, I would go here if I had a Groupon. With the long distance from my house, quality and price, I will look elsewhere before venturing out again.",neutral

"I'm on the hunt for a work related vehicle and I have a big range from potentially something as large as a Mercedes Sprinter, down to a minivan. I'm not a soccer mom, so I'd rather stay away from a minivan.  I came in here one evening to check out a Scion xB to see if it would suit my needs. I was immediately greeted my a sales person who did his little bit to determine what I was looking for. As I was looking for cargo space he made a few suggestions. This turned into the story of Goldilocks and the three bears.  The xB was too small. The Highlander was too big. But the Venza was just right!  Oh yeah, for comparisons sake there was the Sienna too but as I said before: NO MINIVANS!  I was surprised how long it was without being an SUV. It looked nice and the specs seemed to be in line so how does it feel. Time for a test drive.  Right at that moment the salesperson's evening appointment walked in so I was passed on to someone else. He grabbed my license info and said he would meet me around front. After about 20 minutes he finally showed up. Apparently they couldn't find the keys at first and then they couldn't find the car. Painful.  The test drive was good though. I was surprised how the car still felt like a car and not a bulky SUV for its size. Overall I was impressed.  We went back to the office to talk numbers.  At the end of my visit it was good to narrow down what could work out for me on the small end of my potential vehicle range. Now off to find something on the larger end.",neutral

"I came here a couple of times already. I wanted to give them a second chance or third chance, I thought. Anyway, everything wasn't the same as the first time I came. I had a chance to join in their soft opening event with Yelp. Thanks to the Restaurant and Yelp for the great event. It was a blast.  Pressed sushi was incredible.  The dessert, Pina Cotta was unforgettable. The event made me wanted to come back again, and I did. The second time I came with my Yelp friends. We missed their food badly. We ordered a bunch of everything, sushi, sashimi, pressed sushi, tempuras, and dessert. Their service was somewhat slow. They were very busy at the time. But the portion of food was smaller than the first time we came. It was fine for me. I still believed that they just opened and didn't expect many customers in the first few months. So I gave them another chance and came back again. It was last week. This time, it was only my friend and me. She wanted to eat Japanese food, so I recommend her this restaurant. I told her Kaka is well known and I was sure she liked it.   I think my expectation was too high. Our sashimi and other dishes were very tiny.  The worst was salmon sashimi size and sushi rolls. I know that I can order more and more, but I prefer the bigger portion anyway.  It was too tiny and didn't look nice.  The Pina Cotta jelly was bland. The tempuras were difficult to chew. The only thing I like was ""TAKO WASABI"" But I couldn't order the only thing here. I came for all you can eat! I'm sure they can do better than this. Hopefully!

"I am stuck between 3 and 4 - I would give Notorious Burgers a 3-3.5 (A-OK or better) and my boyfriend would give it a 4 (yay! he's a fan!).   I did like the decor entering through the front, but something felt a tiny off in the back main dining room. I can't put my finger on it. Maybe just because it is so dark.   The waitstaff and manager we SO very nice. They were attentive, kind and really really nice. 5 stars on that.   The chocolate shake was good, a bit rich. They don't bring you the extra, just the part of shake that fits into the jar. I should have asked for it at the same time as my food, it was a little runny by the time the food came. My fault.   My boyfriend loved his burger (something with bacon). My cheeseburger was pretty good, nothing life changing, but good. The bun was a little dry - I think that was the biggest drawback.   The fries were not great at all, they were kind of hard - like overcooked (not burnt, just hard, not crispy, but hard).   The cheese curds are probably amazing to 99% of people, but since I don't drink or like the taste of beer, I didn't like them as they are beer battered. I bet you for anyone else though, they would just die over these cheese curds. mmmm.   Overall, our lunch was over $50, which is pretty expensive for just ok/good.   I am sure I will be back to try again.",neutral

"We don't stay in KOA parks often because they tend to be higher in price than other (and sometimes better) parks in the area. We stopped at this one to be close to family we were going to visit.   The Las Vegas KOA at Sam's Town is a destination park. We rate parks as destination when you are staying at the park to visit the surrounding area and not for what the park offers or a park where they have big pools, spas, activities and/or golf courses. Both have their place but usually not when other parks in the same town have both for a similar price. Maybe, they think the casino is the draw-it is a short walk.   We paid approximately $50 per night for the site. It is really a parking lot with sites and some trees, which are the best part. The sites are small gravel which tracks into everything.  We did have a tree that shaded for part of the day which was nice. Most did not have that kind of tree. The reason for the 3 star is that the sites are so close that you can see into the windows of the next RV, if you didn't keep your shades down. Way too close. They walk out to leave and are inches from your place.   I doubt if we would stay here again. We usually stay on the other side of town and I would definitely select that park over this one.

I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.

"First off the service was amazing.  Our waiter, Eric, was an all around star.  Most of the food was great, just way over priced and the portions were too small for the amount.  160 for a fourth of a suckling pig and a bit of salad.  Then a 2 pound bone in rib eye, for 200.  The meat was great but i felt peter lugers is better.  The omelette was perfect.  The croquettes were not cooked all the way through, the lox and bagel cones sucked.  The augratin potatoes were good.  The salted caramel ice cream was amazing but the waffle thing sucked.  then they try to compensate with a bunch of little costco free deserts.  No free bread or table something.  the next night i went to andiamos and had better food, more of it, and for half the price.  sorry but 300 dollars extra for the celebrity chef name is not worth it if the food does not match the hype.  Spent 650 no drinks.  Good place to go if you have an expense account and can order with impunity.",neutral

"Tibet Kitchen. I want to give it a 4-stars, but simply cannot. Here's why:  1) Food: This is a tough one. It may be just Tibetan food, but the entrees we ordered oddly lacked flavor and spice. We ordered the shaptak and chicken chili, both promising a little heat, but it was lacking. It almost had no taste.  2) Service: They were friendly, but slooooooooow. It took awhile to get seated, to take our order, for our food to arrive, and for us to get the bill. The entire experience took around three hours.  Despite the above, the space is beautiful and spacious. They have a back outdoor patio that is perfect. When we went it was full, so it must be popular. Perhaps we're missing something.",neutral

"Came here for the XX time since Bellagio opened recently on Sunday for dinner. I used to come a decent amount when Bellagio first opened but I haven't been here for at least 5-10 years. When Bellagio first opened, i remember how strict they were with not allowing anyone under the age of 21 to enter the hotel. But also, at that same time, Bellagio's buffet was the top buffet in the city offering huge king crab legs, kobe beef, and some other things. I was way too young at that point to really appreciate the quality/quantity but i do remember how it used to be.   We had heard that the buffet had made some changes and improved (from a frequent customer), as well as bring a few popular dishes from a few restaurants to be available at the buffet as well.   - Lago by Julian Serrano's Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce - Harvest by Roy Ellamar's chopped spinach salad with Blue Lizard Farm's bloomsdale spinach, bacon, blue cheese, asparagus and tomato vinaigrette - Noodles' chicken pad Thai with flat rice noodles, chicken, egg, peanuts, bean sprouts and onions - Todd English's Olives' Tuscan farmhouse flatbread with mozzarella cheese, shaved Smithfield ham, asparagus and caramelized onions.  Along with the top mentioned additions, they now offer hot snow crab and Dungeness crab daily as well as a caviar station offering Ikura (salmon row), American black caviar, and red tobiko.   After arrival, we paid and had been sat down pretty quickly. Decor still looks the same as it was before but they now have self-serve drink area near almost every seating area for guests to grab their own drinks, relieving a huge work load off the staff. Full customizable coke machine with juice machine, teas, and coffees.   I was excited to go grab food so i had loaded 3 plates on the first run. 1 plate consisted of hot snow crab. Another plate was crawfish boil and butter clams. Last plate was shrimp cocktail and prime rib.   Hot snow crab. This is one of the depressing things ive seen change over the years at not only this property but all others as well. They went from whole legs to split legs. Loses a lot of the natural crab flavor and juices while adding a whole ton of saltiness from the salted water used to cook the crab. And apparently, this was already LESS salty than the cold crab ! everyone gonna walk out with elevated blood pressure due to the massive amount of salt intake from just crabs... Near the end of our meal, they changed the legs to whole legs. These legs looked much larger but what the crap?! THESE WERE MORE SALTY ! how they were able to attain this result, i have no idea. Despite this, im sure i still had 4 plates worth... They were kind of anal on how much they give. You ask for plate to be filled, they give you a ""covered plate"" of like 7 - 10 scrawny lookin legs until you ask for more.   Crawfish. Tiny baby crawfish overcooked and drying up on the buffet line. Unlike a lot of other places that keep the crawfish in soup/broth/water, this seems like its on a hot plate steaming in its own juices, or whats left of it.   Clams were decent. The creamy butter sauce was nice. Good for dipping crab in too.   As mentioned before, they had a caviar station. Ikura was ok, not as fresh as it should be. Mildly deflated pearls of salmon eggs. Red tobiko is the ""firmest"" of the 3 with a mild salty flavor. The american black caviar was pretty decent. Soft pearls of caviar, lightly salted. Unfortunately, im not too much of a fan of the pancakes they put the caviar on because they were soft and made it weird Lol. I just ate the eggs off and left its vehicle.   No rack of lamb as some of us had hoped for but they had leg of lamb, which was fairly decent. Juicy, tender, and flavorful. WAY better than the ""prime rib"" which was overcooked and dry.   The Julian Serrano's Malloreddus Pasta with pork sausage and tomato sauce was pretty decent. Never had screw type pasta that big which became a good vessle for carrying the sauce.   Some other things i tried include grilled asparagus, pesto mashed potatoes, paella which were all pretty decent  Desserts, they had a good amount of selection. I had a few creme brulee's which were made really well. Super smooth and creamy but not too sweet (i take off the carmelized layer...) Had 2 of these in addition to a creamy smooth cheesecake, key lime tart, lemon meringue tart, various macarons where my friends and I tried to guess the flavor  Service, like mentioned before, the waitress had its load reduced as guests gets their own drinks, was amazing. She was really attentive and had our plates cleared fast ! ! She even cleared our shell plates and brought em back so we constantly had extra plates for shells ! Nice !!  Overall, I mean its decent but maybe not for the price. At a discounted offer currently due to employee pricing, I still feel for the quality you are getting, its still a bit overpaid. I really wish they could return to previous quality, even if less variety is offered",neutral

"My mother loves this place. I personally find it weird that you buy an uncooked pizza then heat up your house baking it... (This is Arizona folks!) but it is I guess a decent idea if you don't mind cooking it yourself. They are pretty generous with the toppings and the toppings seem fresh and of good quality.  Our family favorites are the chicken artichoke and the Mediterranean. However, I am generally underwhelmed by customer service everytime I have been in Papa Murpheys. Just last night, my mother, my husband, and I went in to get a pizza and asked about the specials. Basically they gesture to the two signs... for our reading pleasure... (instead of, you know, advising us what the specials are).  And we end up getting a deep dish meat lovers pizza that was on special... for $14 for a family size not bad- but not something we would usually choose-- and when we leave and are driving home we see a $5 for large pizza deal on a sign one of their employees was holding outside on the street- which they never told us... really?! The truth is we probably would have bought a couple large pizzas instead. We also bought the s'mores dessert pizza and the cheesy bread. Which ended up being buy one ($4) get one side for $2 (a special we weren't told about until we checked out- but hey, I guess better late then never).  So that customer service glitch aside... The meaty deep dish pizza was quite tastey and filling. The cheesy bread had way too little cheese and was just okay- definitely would not purchase again. And the s'mores dessert pizza was actually quite tasty when it came out of the oven when it was all gooey with chocolate and marshmallow goodness- and it disappeared the fastest- no suprise there. :) So, all in all the pizza is pretty good and fresh but this is just not a place my husband and I go to ever on our own- we just don't love it like others seem to. We just get it when we visit my parents because my mom loves it. But I do feel it is worth a try. Just work on the customer service piece a bit more.",neutral

"Friendly cashier, emptyish parking lot (compared to Kung fu tea), a stamp card AND super large drinks that are well priced but...  I ordered a house green tea with less milk because I wanted a stronger tea flavor and that is exactly what I got. Very strong tea but not sweet at all. I did order a regular size with boba but ended up adding some honey to my drink once I got home. I'm not sure if they have sweetener in their cream but next one I'll stick to a regular house green milk tea.  I also ordered a regular Hokkaido milk tea and wanted to add less milk but was told that they can't adjust it because it's a powder and premade. Brew tea allows for adjustments on their Hokkaido milk tea. The Hokkaido milk tea is ok, not overly sweet but definitely not one of my favorites.   Some people compared tea space so half & half. I'm from SoCal and LOVE half and half so I'll be back to try their iced milk drinks.",neutral

We also got complimentary pastries before our meal and the cappuccino, tiramisu and creme brΓ»lΓ©e (although the sugar was a little too thick for our personal taste) was good. Not great, but good.   I'm giving it a 3 star because the food wasn't out of this world amazing, it was average. Also, my Lamb Confit with Hash.. while a little under seasoned, it was good.

"Like several other reviewers, I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it.  I checked out the menu before going and was really scared.  It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  Authentic, Khotan is not. But, hey, it's food and we had a coupon.  The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.  We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.  We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was ""eh,"" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.  I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution, food, and service, but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back.  If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view, however, this is your place.",neutral

Not cheap for students.   I've had the gyro (good) and the Dagwood (meh.) I'd stick with the gyro meat. I love that they have a bevy of spreads and sauces, but again, they definitely charge you for it.   The place is clean, but I've also noticed how employees switch between jobs without changing gloves - which defeats the purpose of the gloves.

We actually had a couple bartenders and a manager scoot us out of a seat because they had priority here.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge supporter of the local craft beer scene in Charlotte and for that I will continue to give them a shot and let them get a few batches in before I swear em' off. However, it is my support of the craft beer scene that makes it hard for me to offer four or five stars (at least right now) when compared to the rest of the breweries in town. Honestly the third star is more for the venue, the vibe and mutual love of good live bands than the beer.  The one beer that I find myself consistently drawn to vs. the rest on the menu is the Friday Star IPA but when it isn't on tap or sold out, I find my visits short-lived.

"Good bar. Decent food. Its tex mex in Pittsburgh, what do you really expect?   Mad Mex is a strange restaurant. The whole thing just feels kind of medium. The food is medium. The service is medium. The prices are pretty medium.   The food itself is always fine, but never out-of-this-world good. Everything from their fajitas to the burritos to the salads taste good, but never much beyond.   For example, on my most recent trip we ordered the 3-dip appetizer. The chips were fine, but not great. The guacamole was good, but not out of the ordinary. The cheese dip and the salsa were less interesting, but fine.   After years of hearing about the fabled ""Gobblerito"" I finally ordered one and I was disappointed. Perhaps the hype was almost impossible to live up to, but I found it to be ""good"". (For those unfamiliar, its turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, corn, black beans  and stuffing in a burrito).

"As mentioned by several other reviewers, my B Good experience was just 'B Okay'.   As a first-timer, I decided to go for their seasonal summer burger. It had a roasted corn salsa, bacon, & avocado on it. The flavor or of the burger was great, but the burger itself was small (i.e. a lot of extra bun around the edges) and overcooked. Had this been a nice juicy burger, this would have definitely warranted a 4-star review. I also think $8 for a burger only (had to pay $1.25 on top of that to add cheese) is steel for a fast casual place. That is honestly sit down price for me, so I'd be hesistant to come back based on that alone. After adding on $3.xx for some sweet potato fries, my meal came to about $14. Again, that's sit-down restaurant pricing.   My wife had gotten one of the quinoa salad/bowl meals, and hers was great. I would steer that route if you're keen on eating here. Sandwiches are definitely not work the hype or expense.   Side note: WHO DOESN'T CARRY RANCH DRESSING?! They had a jalapeno ranch ... can't you just leave the jalapeno out of some of the batch and carry both regular + jalapeno? What kind of savages run this place????",neutral

"I wanted to give SanTan five stars. Perhaps our mistake was coming in on a Saturday night. The place was crammed full of people. You couldn't even walk through the restaurant without running into people.  We decided to stay anyway, and sat outside. It was pretty cool outside, but sitting near a propane torch heater helped. There were some people outside, but nowhere near as many as there were inside.  Here's where it gets odd, for me. Our server came up and introduced himself - after someone else had already taken our beer order - and vanished.  A third person brought us our beer and took my food order. Our server came back, said hi again, vanished. A fourth person brought the food. The mushroom burger *was* pretty tasty, I'll freely admit. The fries were good, too. Our server came back and asked us if we wanted another beer (we did). At this point I've lost track of the different people that have interacted with us tonight, so I don't know if it was a fifth person or one of the previous people coming back to bring our beer. At this point I didn't even know who we were tipping.  tl;dr beer's okay, burger was good, service was weird.",neutral

"Went there for takeout last weekend. Ordered at the bar. Bartender was nice and giving the bar a serious wipe down which I always like to see :) Service for takeout was quick and friendly - they offered us a drink while we waited. They didn't give us any bbq sauce in our takeout bag which was a bummer, but nothing really needed it for our tastes - still I'm sure that would bother some people. Ok, so the food... meh? the chicken wings were the best thing we ordered. They were spicy (not buffalo) and smoked...REALLY good. The brisket... blech! sliced in thick, long blocks, versus thin strips and VERY dry. Worst brisket I've ever had. Not a fan of their coleslaw... bland. We got baby back and St. Louis style ribs as well. Both were good, but nothing memorable. The mac n cheese was super yummy! I'd give them another go sometime, but dine in so at least I could send that sorry brisket back to the kitchen and dare them to eat it!  Hope that helps!",neutral

So here is my review.. I order food online from the yelp app at 7:15 and got my food at 8:37.. Extant ion was 45 to an hour..special instructions weren't so specially to say lots of soy sauce on the side.. I was ol u provided with 2 little 2 go cups barely filled with soy sauce.. They had the cheap soy sauce at that (lay choy) instead of kikoman.. There are certain things u can't skimp on.. My egg rolls were a little greasy but still crispy after all of the wait.. I also got pork fried rice which was hot upon arrival but the pork was bland.. Hence the need for soy.. I doin dnt have a car today and had to order delivery.. Not too many options in my area.. I want to hold help accountable as well.. If a place does not deliver timely or anywhere near it they should remove that option from the app.. With that being said the driver was extremely nice.. I would order again if I had no vehicle once again,neutral

"Red Robin is and always will be a mediocre hamburger restaurant with a variety of appetizers. The entire menu is burgers, that's their thing. I guess you also have to mention they have the speckled lemonades and decent iced tea as well.   My last venture to Red Robin was because I was out with a friend in Henderson and we needed a place to grab lunch. Well, I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile so we figured hey why not.  We arrived a bit after lunchtime so the place was pretty dead. We were seated fairly promptly and the service was good. Our waiter didn't mess up our order, he checked up on us, etc.   I ordered a chicken sandwich. Honestly I can't even remember the name, but it was of the grilled variety. The only thing I can really say about it is I did not enjoy the super white breaded bun it came on. I just think I've become used to better slices of bread. I've become spoiled by other places I suppose. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich as well and I believe hers had some pineapples on it.   Their large steak fries were tasty and add a bit of variety to the meal. The waiter also asked us if we would like certain types of sauces to dip the fries in, which was nice of him.  Overall the food was okay, the service was very nice and competent, the restaurant was clean, and so was the bathroom. They do have a bar at the back of this location. I didn't realize that came standard with Red Robin, but hey, it does.  Would I be back? Hmmm. Possibly. But there are a lot of better places to get a burger in Vegas.",neutral

"The gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night here really remind me of the gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night in Chicago. And so does the seedy, butt-ugly atmosphere of this place. But if eating some of the best gyros ever in Chicago has taught me one thing, it's not to judge a gyro place by its cover. Parthenon Gyros is no dirtier than the kitchen located right next to the counter, in true big-city style.   The fries are usually cooked and seasoned very well, and they don't do a bad job with things like the spanakopita either. I love the tzatziki sauce; you get a good 50/50 mix of yogurt and mint in the aftertaste. Like every other topping, including the gyro meat, it is generously piled on top of the bread (another one of their most outstanding ingredients).  Parthenon is very fast-foody, but I don't know a good gyro place that isn't. So if you want to escape the dining room that looks like a bathroom, go to the rooftop tables. You can watch State Street go by while you eat one of the best gyros in Madison.  Oh, and they serve beer.",neutral

"When I found out that my coworkers love Pho I started disliking them a little less. Just kidding! (in case they read my reviews, lets not make this awkward for everyone).  They were raving about this Pho place really close to work, so we decided to make a lunch trip and reserve a table for 8. When we arrived at noon, we found a mob of pretty disgruntled people inside, waiting to be seated. I quietly asked if they had put their name down or anything and was cut off by a lady in full rage about being ""in line"" for a table because no one had taken her name down.  To anger the lady even further, I grabbed a server and let her know we had a reservation for 8, in which we were immediately seated in the first 2 available 4-person booths. Unfortunately for me, I was facing the angry lady. Sorry yo- we made reservations. *awkwardly looks away*.  Although this Pho place serves a pretty big Thai menu (WTF?) I figured going for traditional Vietnamese pho was the way to go. I got my usual round-eye steak and brisket pho while my coworkers went for the #1 ""all the meat"" Pho. Our food came soon enough and after drowning it in herbs, lime juice and chili sauce, we dug in.    I have to say I have no complaints about the taste of the Pho but I can't dare give it 5 stars. It was tasty (as Pho usually is), but the broth wasn't particularly aromatic or flavorful and the meat was not good quality.  Was it tasty? Yes. Would I eat it again? Sure. Would I take people here over other pho places in the area? No way. There are way tastier places with better components nearby. At $8 it was a decent lunch, but nothing to rave my fellow Yelpers about.",neutral

My friends got the set course meal: braised octopus starter, oyster starter, Lamb w/ risotto, creme brule. The octopus was strange because of the texture. I like the natural chewiness of the octopus, but braised octopus just tastes weird! The risotto was delicious and so was the lamb, and the creme brule was an excellent finish.

"Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.  This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this.   According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).  The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.  Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.",neutral

The food and pizza are very good. Most of all the salads. I really love the bread they use for the sandwiches. It's that big soft bun that just soaks up the sauce or what ever you have on it. The salads are never skimpy and full of flavor. I really love the ranch they use.  It's a place you always have to order way ahead of time because it's almost never ready when they say it is. Now you could say it's because they are busy and yes most of the time they are but when they say 20min they mean 35 or 40. But you don't want to show up late because if your food is ready you don't want it getting cold. I would give this place a 5 or 4 and of ordered more from them if they did not have that issue. It's just this issue. But the food is so good I went back so its worth a shot. Just remember the times issue when you order.,neutral

The gamey lamb flavor really stood out. 4 rolls for $7. I was also able to sample my friends meat rolls wrapped in Betal leaf. The taste was very different! Pungent spices all around.  I  was boring and had the pho, no complaints.",neutral
"Food is okay.  Service is lousy.  Took us 20 minutes to get drinks.  When the meal was done, the server didn't offer any dessert, coffee, or after dinner drinks.  He just brought us the bill and said ""adios.""  (More or less).  Wouldn't go back.",neutral
"I absolutely love Mexican food, so I'm always on the lookout for restaurants like the Steel Cactus. Granted, I consider Steel Cactus a little lower on the quality scale than most other Mexican restaurants, but they have a great happy hour which my roommates and I frequent.   One of the things I really like about the Steel Cactus is the rooftop bar. This is such a fun place to be in the summertime, enjoying a fruity drink and looking out over Shadyside. As I mentioned, my roommates and I usually come for the happy hour, so I can't speak too much to the regular entrees. Concerning the happy hour - it's one of the best we've found in the burgh. They have a whole list of house wines (about six of them, I believe) that are $3 a glass...and they are pretty healthy pours! Additionally, all of the specialty cocktails are only $5. I appreciate this a lot as I enjoy getting cocktails but most happy hours only put one or two cocktails on special. I usually get the mojito; it's pretty good, and there aren't many other restaurants in the city that offer mojitos year-round.  On the food scene, all of the appetizers are half off which turns out to be a great deal when you come with a few friends. For example, the guacamole is usually $8, down to $4 at happy hour, and thus only a little over $1 per person if you come with two other friends. You can't beat that! My roommates and I LOVE dips, so we always go straight for the guacamole and the queso dip. The quesadillas with chicken are good as well. One of my friends is gluten-free, and she was easily accommodated by switching out the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla on the quesadillas.   Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had? Well, no, not by a long shot. But man, you can't beat the prices! If you're looking for delicious authentic Mexican food, the truth is that you probably want to look elsewhere. But the Steel Cactus is always a great choice if you're looking for a super cheap happy hour where you can share a few tasty drinks and apps!",neutral

"My mom, cousin and I went to Oak Steakhouse on a Thursday evening for drinks and appetizers around 6:30 p.m. I did make a reservation and upon arrival we were seated quickly. I had been wanting to try this restaurant out for months because I saw posts about it on Charlotte Agenda's Instagram page and then started following Oak's Instagram page. Unfortunately it was not the dining experience I hoped for, but it also was not terrible. Like other reviews mentioned, the service was slow and the time it took for the food and drinks to come out was absolutely ridiculous! That is the one thing I actually hated about the restaurant. The decor is perfect and that is one of the main reasons I wanted to give the restaurant a try. It's a somewhat smaller restaurant but with an open and airy feel. I'm in love with the dark hardwood floors, dark tables and chairs (minus the cute red booth in the center of the restaurant) and high ceilings. The food was pretty good to me, everything seasoned perfectly. I had shrimp cocktail and scallops for my appetizer. Although both were VERY good, I hate lukewarm food and my scallops could have been a little hotter. For my meal I had the oak salad and added steak on top. I was in love! IF I ever decide to go back I would definitely get all the items I ordered again. The drinks were definitely yummy! I did not see a drink I wanted on the menu so I asked the server to ask the bartender to make something light and fruity and the bartender did their thing, taste wise. However I do feel they were a little stingy with the alcohol. I did not taste a whole lot of it in my drink. Disappointing. Last but not least, our server. So our server was not bad at all. He just didn't seem all that interested in his job and I didn't feel he was as attentive as he should have been. He did check on us, however there were times I had to flag him down for another drink or food order. He was young, and just overall had a weird disposition. One thing I did appreciate was the manager coming over and apologizing about how long our food took. I was actually a little surprised by how long we waited each time we ordered food. There could possibly be an issue with the amount of kitchen staff they currently have because one large party should not stop the flow of the restaurant. All in all I am unsure if I will be back. I feel the customer service can be improved and the length of time it takes for the food to come out can be improved. Stronger drinks would have been nice too. My bill was $96 and I left the server an additional $15. If I do decide to go again I'll probably just sit at the bar.",neutral

"My fiancee and I went there in December 2013 for dinner. We ordered some cocktails, a bottle of wine, 3 appetizers and 2 mains. Everything was delicious EXCEPT our main of scallops. Disgusting. Old scallops- smelled and tasted bad. We left the majority of the plate untouched. When the server came to clean off our table, she didn't ask if anything was wrong with it or how we enjoyed the food. Nada. THAT was disappointing.",neutral

"Pros: Great games for kids and adults of all ages. There are only a few ""gun"" games and those are easily avoided if you have little ones (or big ones). For $25 the three of us played about 15 games which took us about 30 minutes. This was perfect amount of time for a 4 year old plus mom and dad looking forward to dinner after. The games seemed modern and felt pretty clean.  Cons: The smell (upstairs) of spilled beer made me feel as if I jumped back in time to the crappy bars of my early twenties. Bartender didn't seem knowledgable about the beers - I asked for a Laganitas and she didn't know what I was talking about, but the beer was on the menu. My husband went back and showed her that they do carry it.  We did not eat here - so I can't comment on the food. The downstairs bar smelled much better than upstairs. Will come back again!",neutral

"Ambiance: Upscale and trendy spot in the the Yard. The sparse decor with minimalist stylings along with the white tile walls gives the place a sterile vibe. Patrons are typically 30 and above and a little less rowdy than those visiting the other establishments in the Yard.  Food/Service: The three varieties of oysters we tried were good however I can't comment on which ones we especially liked as the server-help couldn't remember which ones were which...very disappointing and I expected a little better service when dropping that much money on food.  The Maine lobster roll was delicious but portions were rather small. The warm jar of crab was also awesome.  Price: On the high end, reasonable for quality but unreasonable for portions.  Overall: Could be a four star establishment as the food was great but with the less than stellar service and small portions gotta go three stars. The place is still a great option for quality seafood. Probably still in my top three.",neutral

"So, after reading the Yelp reviews, I knew there were two menus...and apparently one only (the more authentic one?) gets offered to ""Asian-looking"" customers. So I wasn't surprised when partner and I were given the ""other"" menu when we walked in on a Saturday night. One thing I liked instantly about the place is that it's spacious, with enough distance between the tables, and is well-lit. The restaurant was pretty full when we came in, at about 7, but we were immediately given a place to sit. For appetizers, we got the fried wontons with mustard and hot sauce dips. I thought the wontons were a little too crispy, and I would have liked some more filling in them. The service was fast and efficient, and we got the appetizers within seven minutes of being seated. For the main course, I got the Happy Family and partner got the Cashew chicken. They came with a medium sized bowl full of steamed rice. I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here. Also, I think everyone, regardless of whether they are Asians or not,  should be given both the menus. Whether I want to eat stomach of pork in sauce or pig's feet, is a choice I would like to make!",neutral

"I love a good German bier hall as much as the next girl, but this place really brings out my best and my wurst.   I've averaged the 5 and the 1 for a three star. I'd go back because it is so pretty, but I don't know that I would organize an event there in the near future either.  My first visit was during Oktoberfest, a bit of a gong show in the giant basement. Having just gotten back from Germany, it was fun to see the big picnic tables out and about, and the German band in full swing. The atmosphere was great, tons of people but still space to sit, our server was on it and the food that I stole off my friends plate was quite tasty! Overall, a 5 star experience! I love the decor - earthy, European, and just plain stylin'.  I was a little bit disappointed by the beer selection, but I grabbed the sampler, sat back and enjoyed the double headed bird decor. When we finally left a little bit early, I was surprised to see a big line coming out the door.  My second experience emphasized a lot of my bar pet peeves. First of all, I was late meeting some friends, and thought if I got there by 9, I'd beat the line. Not so. And not only that, the bouncer was not interested in letting me join my friends at their table and was downright rude. So, after a little friend- guilt tripping and a too long wait with them, we made it in for some increasingly bad service.  The drinks are, let's face it, overpriced for what they are, which I can live with when everything else comes together. But my second visit was a one star. Either Wurst is a little bi-polar, is getting a little too popular and its going to their heads, or the best time to come down is during lunch or dinner.",neutral

"This is a popular place, so be forewarned if you plan on coming here on the weekends! Our party of three arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday to find the place absolutely packed! We ended up having to wait almost 40 minutes before we were seated, or even truly looked at. While I understand that they're busy, the customer service could improve.  I ordered the three eggs (chose mine poached) and chose to pay an extra $3 to substitute homefries for fruit. I wanted to replace the toast, but apparently the fries and fruit are more expensive and ergo can only substitute each other. The poached eggs, poached medium, were heavenly. I was also given a sizeable amount of fruit - it was a pretty layout of alternating pineapples and orange slices. Yum!  My friend ordered the three eggs (sunny side up) with smoked Polish sausage and the homefries. I had some of hers... Delish! The other friend got the banana peanut butter waffle, which comes topped with whipped cream. It was utterly heavenly. The banana and peanut butter wasn't too sweet, but had the perfect pairing.  Our waitress was friendly, but you could tell that they were super busy and a little understaffed. Nevertheless, still a decent brunch place in Sauga City!",neutral

The food from the snack bar was decent but I would have preferred to try one of the restaurants.   Seating, picking your seat is very nice because you for have to show up to the theater an hour early for a decent seat. The premium seats are the way to go because you get the wait service with them.

I didn't find anything that I just HAD to have, but there were some cute little things in there.   Now on to the restaurant. It seemed too crowded and I was a little unsure where to enter and exit the establishment. But overall the food hit the spot and I thought our server was very sweet. The dining experience was decent, but I think I'd rather opt for a less cluttered place with a healthier, menu full of local and fresh items in the future.",neutral

Overall pleasant stay but nothing spectacular to call out. Rooms seem to have received a minor facelift in the past couple of years.

Facilities are adequate; had bfast one morning and it was meh with the price tag to go with it.   The best part is the location of the hotel in Charlotte - easy walking distance to everything!

"We found this place when Yelping around midnight on a Tuesday night, when we craved some midnight pho, and found out that this is the only pho place that's open past 11pm around the North York area, so we gave it a shot  We ordered take out and the house special pho, as well as their curry brisket beef dish over the phone,  the lady on the phone indicated they would be ready to pickup in 20 min.   When I arrived at the restaurant to pickup around midnight,  I was surprised to see there were quite a few  tables occupied oat midnight on a Tuesday night, I asked the owner and they indicated they open daily until 4am except Mondays!  that's pretty convenient for people living in the area craving pho past midnight~ I guess they are competing for the same clientele as nearby Owl and the rest of the 24 hr Korean restaurants in the area, nice to see there's a bit more variety in the late night dining scene in North York.  The House special pho in take out packages came in separate containers for the soup broth, noodles, as well as the bean sprouts etc, which is great as it maintain the freshness of all ingredients.   They actually provided a clear plastic bowl for the noodles so I guess you could potential just pour the broth into the plastic bowl container with the noodles and ingredients,  which would be very convenient ( we used our own bowls at home instead).  The soup broth is good but not the best we've tried. The curry is a little bit on the oily side but is tasty,  at midnight I wouldn't mind it, but I prob won't come here during regular dinner hours.  Nevertheless, I'm still glad that we have access to latenight pho uptown now, I would recommend this place as a late night snack option~",neutral

As a server myself, I know you can get busy and she was but not checking on us kinda put a damper on me wanting to order more food. I ended up getting it to-go. I was not impressed at all.

I first sat at the sushi bar for about ten minutes before anyone even spoke to me or greeted.  The sever brought me water after many minutes with a menu and I sat for at least another ten minutes and thought about leaving. I finally walked a few steps over to the sushi chef and ordered the Spicy scallops and a cucumber roll.  The spicy scallop roll was bland, but the fish was good. The cucumber roll was very good.  No one ever checked back with me once. I had to take out my credit card to get attention to get a to go box and pay.  There are many other sushi bars to visit, so I wouldn't go out of my way again.",neutral

When ordering sweet crepes, you get to choose a flavor and 2 fruits of your choice. They also give you an option for a different type of batter as well; red velvet, whole wheat (I think it was), and regular. Ice cream is an additional $1. I went with a regular Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana. The crepes are pretty huge and they fill it with whatever fruit you chose. And they definitely don't skimp out on the fruit too, so that's a plus.  I also ordered an iced Nutella latte, which I could've don't without lol.  The ladies behind the counter were really nice though. Super friendly and quick with their service.",neutral

"We looked up reviews on yelp for a place to eat and this place had great reviews and the pictures of the food looked great so, not being from Rock Hill we thought we would give it a try.  The pub was not very busy when we went in about 6:45pm, we had plenty of tables to choose from.  We was handed our menus and the waitress took our drink orders.  When she brought our drinks we placed an order for the spinach cheese dip for an appitizer, she looked at us and asked, ""so, you want me to put that order in now?"".  Ummm....yes please.  When the spinach cheese dip came to table we had to ask for silverware and napkins, and we placed our order, this is about 7:15pm.  I do not think we recieved the right appitizer, it was a cheese dip but there was no spinach, we was all very hungry from our trip so we was willing to try it, it was really good.  So, we didn't say anything about the wrong order.  Our order was 3 different chicken wraps one with fries, one with tator tots and one with onion rings and 4th order was a grilled chicken salad.  We did not get our food until a few minutes past 8pm.  I sincerely thought they lost our order and we was getting ready to leave when our food came to the table. Our food was cold; the fries, tots or onion rings.  I'm sure they would have been really good hot and fresh but cold and greasy was not good at all.  Our wraps was a good size, we was so hungry we ate the wraps, even cold the sauce on the chicken was amazing!  One had teriyaki sauce and one had cajun sauce, 3rd was Mediterranean, our daughter said it was good.  Other daughter had the salad, thank goodness the salad came out cold, LOL, she said her salad was good.  So, this place would have recieved 5 stars had it not been for the bad waitress and cold food.  If they ever figure out how to fix those small problems this place would probably be one of the best in Rock Hill.  The amout of sauce options for wings (also the chicken wrap) was amazing!  We have family in town so the next time we visit we will probably give it another chance.  We love mom and pop restaurants, we prefer to support local businesses wherever we go.  I hope next time I can change my review and give the 5 stars they probably deserve.",neutral
"meh. it's just another neighbourhood pub. if i want to hammer back multiple $6 drinks and stagger home instead of taxi/drive/ride/mass transit it home, this is the place to go. their wings + ribs are good (on wing/rib nights when it's not a rip off) and the rest of the menu is, well, meh. it's just another sports bar in just another canadian city. you'd think that if they were in such close proximity to a loyal university demographic, they would pride themselves on that (ie: becoming the official bar of the DINOS, being that the UofC student bar, the den, hasn't claimed that yet) instead of ""basing"" the entire place on some fire fighter in some city in the opposite end of another country (apparently, Moose McGuire was a heroic fire fighter in Chicago).   oh, and they no longer give out free peanuts by the basket-load. i don't know if this was the result of the proud Albertan tradition of cutting-corners or of the proud Canadian tradition of a minority of whiny liberals having the power of a majority by complaining about a minority condition like peanut allergies. the one thing that distinguished this strip-mall pub from all the other strip mall pubs is now gone.  when i get thrown out by the bouncers for being too drunk, they're at least polite. i can give them that.  yawn.",neutral

"We visited Planet Hollywood right after it opened several years ago and were totally wowed.  As is true for most things in Vegas, however, it has not worn well.  For example, the Roman shade in our room was jerry-rigged open with a hanger from one of the closets.  Classy.  All that said, the price was fair, the location was decent.  They just opened Gordon Ramsey's BURGR restaurant, which was pretty good; very generous dinner for two with appetizers, entrees, sides and dessert for $60.  Expect a younger crowd, and if you're even remotely serious about your gambling, expect that younger crowd to be an utter disappointment at the tables.  They can screw up a game of blackjack without even blinking, and then wonder why the rest of the table is giving them the stinkeye.",neutral

The person I went with had some sort of amazing meat-happy sandwich that I drooled over the whole time I ate. This is what Kazansky's is about: fist sized sandwiches that will give you heart problems in years to come- but that give you now a meat-a-licious way to fatten up for the winter months.

"Spending two hours rallying really works up a girl's appetite, so I decided to come and try this place out, as I've been meaning to for awhile and been too lazy to leave my hermit cave of an apartment.  I ordered the Cooper's Burger and it was pretty good: grass-fed beef, pork belly, some fresh lettuce and a nice aioli to taste. The food was easily four stars and was pretty good.  The bathrooms are kept very clean (although, there's only one). The service is also pretty decent; I've seen some inconsistencies here about it and I was a little weary before I walked in, but I must've been lucky and came on a good day because my waiter and the manager were both quite friendly.  This place is pretty small and some of the seating is kind of awkward; I was placed inbetween two groups by myself when there was plenty of other seats elsewhere. I'm sure it might've been easier on the waiters, but it was just kind of weird to be seated next to a family and two guys talking about finances.  Also, the alcohol list is pretty nice; at least 3 pages on beer alone. Kind of hot, actually, even if I'm not huge on beer.  That said, it's a pretty affordable place, the service is relatively friendly if you come in on a good day, and it's got a nice view of the capitol. But I'd avoid bringing large groups of people and kids--don't think this is a good place for either.",neutral

From  their mixed drinks (Yum on the Strawberry Martini)  to their apps (my personal faves are the sweet corn tamale cakes and the factory nachos now- thanks to my husband for the love of the nachos), and their huge variety of well, EVERYTHING.    The only problems with this place are when you have such a variety, you may do a lot of things well, but not great... and this is the case here.

"Okay, full disclosure time: The day we went it was about 98 degrees. I have no doubt this plays heavily into my overall review.  First of all if it is going to be hot the day you come, bring water AND AN UMBRELLA.  There is SOME shade, but not much.  The tour guides are tremendously friendly and happy to answer any questions that you have.  If you are interested in the Neon history of Las Vegas, this is the place to see the past.  I do wish they had some photographs or something to allow you to see the signs in their original glory. While I'm sure this is not possible for EVERYTHING here, famous ones like The Desert Inn or Sassy Sally surely they could do.  At some point there is going to be a ""Visitors Center"", so hopefully this will have something like that.  By all means I absolutely recommend seeing it if you can, but I'm not kidding about the heat.  My poor iPhone kept bringing up the Temperature Warning as I was trying to take pictures. But it was a wonderful opportunity to see these signs.",neutral

"I was staying at The Palms Place, where the restaurant is, and so my group of girl friends went to Simon for dinner.  The decor was very modern, and the restaurant was pretty empty for a 730pm dinner reservation on a busy weekend, but I enjoyed our relaxing dinner despite the hectic strip.  The menu was pretty confusing - sushi, fusion food, pizzas, seafood, American. Everything seemed to be somewhat Asian inspired, except the pizzas.  We got a little bit of everything: calamari, Margarita pizza, crispy creamy shrimp, cucumber sushi, cotton candy and creme brulee and a bunch more dishes (I didn't eat all of them, so I can't recall all of them). My favorite was the crispy creamy shrimp, which is funny since I don't eat a ton of seafood. It was a great app to share with friends. The food came out in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly. It was pretty pricey, and the food was good but nothing too exciting that I would definitely want to come back here again.  I would say this is a good place for a nice dinner in Vegas, especially if you are staying at The Palms or one of its other hotels, but there is a lot more exciting places you can eat in Vegas.",neutral

"We thought this would be a special place to take out of town guests for a Christmas celebration before they left for home.  It was a disappointment in many ways. The restaurant was freezing!  We were by the thermostat (59 degrees) and it never climbed beyond  60 degrees the whole time we were there. Also, we made reservations and our table was across from the kitchen door and by the service station.  I asked for another table but was told the others had been reserved.  What?  So we ordered drinks hoping to warm up!  The service staff was very friendly if a little hurried so the drinks were fine.  Food was ok but nothing special.  A very expensive experience and disappointing since our daughter and her friend were visiting for the holidays.  We should have dined somewhere else.   On the positive side, we would go back and have a drink in warmer weather and enjoy the city view.  If you are looking for great food, this is not the place.  There are much better restaurants in Charlotte.",neutral

There was a one-time fee of 100 for the dog (no matter how long your stay was) which was reasonable. They gave you a little magnet to stick onto your door knob to let people know that there was a pet inside.  We had a one bedroom ""suite"" complete with living room and kitchenette.  The kitchenette had all the plates, pots, pans, utensils and paper towels which really worked out for us.  They had a really good complimentary hot breakfast in the morning and we would just take our food from the buffet and bring it up back to our room. We weren't too far from the strip and there were two restaurants right next to the property.  I would recommend this hotel if you needed a pet friendly place to stay in Las Vegas.",neutral

"Dined here with my partner the other evening. Our experience was not the greatest. The hostess was professional and we were seated in a timley manner. Our waiter soon arrived with water and we placed our order. I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake SautΓ©ed Maryland Style with Spicy Chive Remoulade  as my appitizer and the Georges Bank Scallops SautΓ©ed with Citrus Fruit, Roasted Almonds and Brown Butter for my main course. My appetizer was first to arrive. The crab cake did not have a balanced temperature, the outside was hot, and the inside was cold, it also had parts of the shell in it. I didnt even finish the Crab Cake because in almost every bite there was a piece of shell. My Main course arrived and i was happy to see that the waiter made sure not to have almonds in it. The Scallops were delicious the fresh citrius fruit went perfect with it. The Scallops was the best part of my entire experience. My partner on the other hand had a dry chewy meal and was disappointed with the amount a vegetable put on the dish. If you state that there are greens beans in the dish we should be able to see the green beans and not have to pick thru the vegetables trying to figure out what is what.  When observing the floor we noticed that the waiters were not attentive to thier tables, I guess a football game is more important than thier guests.   The restraunt is very upscale the waiters are wearing formal clothing I thought that we would have been treated better.  I would go back for the scallops but not the service.",neutral

"This location is fortunate to have Caleb as an associate. He's the reason this store has gotten any stars from me.  He alone delivers 5 star customer service whereas a colleague of his was more interested in being right than anything else.  I'll try to keep it short.  We were looking for a door latch that is fitted for older doors.  An adjustable one.  The colleague whose department is locks and hardware was adamant that all door handles only come in adjustable latches that fit standard door sizes.  Never once said that it's possible to buy just the latch and have it fit to a door handle/knob. Never once looked up any items that would fit the description.  Caleb on the other hand opened door handle boxes with me, asked another associate that would be more knowledgable and then looked online. The associate he spoke to understood what I was looking for and  He found the product I was looking for at a competitor's location. All the while he was calm, professional and helpful.    Otherwise, it's a hit or miss here.  We've shopped at this location, no word of a lie, at least 30 times in the last 6 months as we are doing renovations.  Anyway, there are a few gems that work at this location and one can find most of what you need for your home and garden.",neutral

We made reservations, and it turned out not to be completely necessary as the place wasn't crowded.  Still, I always recommend if you can plan ahead.  Service was kind and efficient and they gladly brought out whatever we needed in a timely way.  Having said that, I found the meat to be fatty for me, and the accompaniments weren't that great.  They gave us a corn and cheese casserole for one of our sides that tasted like can corned sprinkled with cheese.  Also, the meat really stuck to our grill so bad they had to get us another.

For starters I decided to try their Tuna Tostada, 4/5 well presented, fresh slice of Tuna served on a Taco chip with a mango and ginger glaze. great starter with bang of flavor!  The entree was 2.5/5 Peruvian crispy chicken bowl served with shredded veggies, guacamole, cilantro, peanuts and sesame drizzled with a lemon caper vinaigrette. Overall dish was OKAY, but had a kick of spice. the Chicken could have been marinated longer if anything.  For dessert I tried their banana coconut cream pie served in a glass cup with layers of coconut cream custard, slice of banana and toasted coconut shavings on top...great way to end a meal. 3.5/5.",neutral

"Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.  For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).  Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.

"Noodles were decent, but I was a bit let down by the bowl of ramen I had here.  Could have hyped myself too much and expected a lot.  Overall the dining experience was okay.  The place was about a 30 minute drive if you are coming from uptown.  And the dining space was very cozy... 8 tables total.    We got there right at 7pm on a Sunday... and the place did fill up after we sat down.  Our server was nice and gave us a lot of time to peruse the menu.  Ended up getting the YUME hamachi appetizer (price was incorrectly listed on the menu, but the server came by to check with us if the increase in price was ok).  And then I ordered the spicy miso ramen bowl... which was good.... but the pepper strings in it really just blew my pallet out and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest of my meal.  I want to just mention that Charlotte/Matthews ramen scene is still relatively young so I expect these trail blazer restaurants to have their food on point.  The few other places that do offer ramen are ranking a little higher than YUME in my book.  I will have to come back and try another ramen bowl (maybe not the spicy one) but I am really glad to see a place like this open up in the suburbs because it shows the diverse food culture that North Carolinians are ready for and craving.",neutral

Go somewhere else if you want good Thai food. Service was great. The ladies were really nice.",neutral

"Came here for a bachelorette party last Saturday night with my 4 girlfriends. We got there after 10 pm and were able to skip the line and the cover charge (they have a Ladies Line). Once inside we were offered seating in the VIP area which was amazing! They even let us dance up on a platform. Unfortunately, that fairy tale ended when someone actually purchased the table, but it was fun while it lasted. The staff in and around the VIP area were very cool and accommodating even though we hadn't paid to be there.  The bartender mixed a nice strong Patron margarita, and I didn't think $14 was too bad a price for that considering Bud Lights were $10. I'll pay the extra $4 and get top shelf liquor, thanks. The DJ played really good music; kind of a top 40/hip hop/dance mash-up. The only thing was, like others have said, he would switch songs too soon and there were a few times the whole club stopped dancing because there wasn't a good beat going. Side note: the music was extremely loud. It took a good hour after we left for my ears to stop ringing. Not a complaint, just a comment. The bouncers outside the VIP area weren't quite so cool, and them waving their little flashlights around got annoying (major power trip). All in all, this was a better club experience than I've had in the past, although that is probably because in the past I've always had guys with me and this time I was with a group of ladies. I might go back if the clubbing mood struck me.",neutral
"The food here is never anything outstanding, except for their pies.  We have eaten Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner here and have rarely been disappointed.

"The Skinny:  it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but that doesn't really say much (3) service - a little sluggish but then again, I came with the Yelp bunch so there was a lot of us. It took a while to get our orders but through the register (3) value - with the internet coupon, we got a soda and a large pizza for $14 between two people - not too bad.  We came here with low expectations of the food. Really, the main draw was to support the group of Yelpers in the Graziano's Monster Challenge (10lbs of pizza, 45 minutes). Shout outs to Jen S. who set up the UYE - it was a lot of fun for the supporters... er... maybe not so much fun for the competitive eaters - LOL!  Overall, for our food, I split a soda and pizza with my hubby for $14 (the soda was for me). The pizza crust had a nice crispness to the bottom however it was rather doughy for me. Toppings were okay - not great. I would say probably your average store bought pizza - nothing more or less.  The most impressive thing was our champion eaters - who would need to eat the equivalent of three large pizzas each to finish the monster challenge. Although ultimately none of the Yelp teams finished their 10 pound monster, it was enough to have tried to complete this difficult task.",neutral
"I've never been go karting (unless you count playdium) so this was a new experience for me. We originally went to another location and the wait time was an hour and 40 minutes. So u called this location up and they told us the wait time was Max 15 minutes and they were super cheerful over the phone wishing us a happy new year so I instantly felt a good vibe.   Upon walking in I instantly got a whiff of gasoline. The go karts run on gas so it smells (unless you like the smell of gas, weirdo). At the front desk the guys were super nice, informative and overall you could tell they really enjoy their jobs.  After signing the waiver and putting in my protective gear, I was on the track ready to go.   Overall the experience was fun but not something I would do on the regular. The cars go super fast. If you have a need for speed you will love it (my bf did). The wheel is stuffer than a regular car so it takes dime getting used to.

"I am kind of surprised that parties of two got seated quickly! I was there on a Thursday at noon, and the wait was roughly 40-50 minutes. We got seated when it was out turn. It was chilly outside, so one of the servers brought out some mint tea in disposable cups. How nice!   Ordered the Cairo classic and mind blowing chicken. The portions were big, and the prices were fair. But... never have I ever seen a brunch spot charge for drip coffee by size. And it didn't  seem like there  was significant difference between the small and medium. And to top it off, I didn't love the coffee.   The food was very good! Everything was spicy - not heat, but bold flavours. That's what differentiates Maha's from most brunch spots. As most people mentioned, it did take a while for the food to come out, which doesn't help the table turnover at such a busy restaurant. We had the window seat, and I actually ate quickly because I felt very self conscious about the line of people watching me ""take my time"". It's in my head, but still, faster service would have made it better.   Do I think it's worth the 40-50 minute wait... maybe on a nice day with good company... or when they have the patio open, so turnover is faster. I do recommend you try it out at least once!",neutral

"Great service, nice atmosphere which will be even better in the summer when the overhead doors are open. We also enjoyed the food, although we were hoping for a fresher California feel. The menu is heavy on chicken, pork and bacon and there weren't too many vegetarian options. I was happy to see a few seafood dishes but they often had pork (shrimp tacos are my favorite but they had bacon lardon, so I passed). I finally settled on the Hawaiian truck style shrimp which was delicious, if small for the price ($16.50 for a medium bowl I easily finished). We'll be back, but hope there will be menu rotations occasionally with more vegetarian and seafood options.  Update: We tried Bear and Bottle again and the experience wasn't great. We stopped for a drink after a movie. It was about 9:30 or 10:00, and the host seemed slightly put out that we were coming in. This may be because the entrance is awkward, so the host has to leave the stand to greet you. There are two doors and the front one was partially blocked by carts and signs (but there were still plenty of people inside). The service was slow. We had to order at the bar while the table next to us had a server. I like the space and there are some good qualities, but sadly this place is falling a little flat for us.  Update: I was happy to see a bean burger added to the menu, but sadly it was disappointing. Way too thick and mealy. A bean burger is best when it's a little thinner so the beans retain some firmness and the edges crisp. The flavor was good but the texture was awful. And to add insult to injury, there was a $1.50 upcharge for it!   I had such high hopes for a California inspired restaurant. I was dreaming of simple fish or shrimp tacos, veggie dishes, limey drinks and fresh guacamole. We'll continue to support Bear and Bottle but will stick to drinks on the patio.",neutral

"Had my first twin peaks experience last weekend. Here's my review: 1. ""Scenic Views"" - Excellent!  The girls are hot and also personable (at least our waitress was personable).  I joked with my friends that they must recruit at eating disorder clinics as the only chunky girls or girls with any fat or cellulite in the place were customers. The waitresses here stop to chit chat with their customers not just drop off food and drinks and run.    2.  Sports watching: Good.  Lots of TVs ring the bar. we were there to watch Sunday NFL games and all 5 of us have different favorite teams and we were all able to see a TV from our table that had our respective games on them.  Of course you're only getting sound from the big draw game going on but that's everywhere.  3.  Food:  Average/Fair: Nothing memorable, and not a very big selection of food offerings.  The waitresses, who BTW are very good promoters & up-sellers of their food and products, definitely make the limited menu items sound better than they actually were. Not that the food was disappointing or bad, it was just a little over exaggerated/oversold. I and a couple others had hangover burgers which is an average burger with a fried egg on it,  Burgers comes with fries which are the thick steak fry kind and they are seasoned. For the price it would've been nice if it had a couple more topping options were offered with the burger, but how it came out was adequate. My friend had the Philly cheese steak which I had part of.  Now a disclaimer: I'm from Philly originally so rarely do I give a cheese steak outside of the Philly/NJ?NY area a positive review because so often they are missing one or more important parts of what makes a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Twin Peak's version was no exception...I'd call it a decent cheese steak but not a good Philly Cheese Steak.  Another friend had the pork nachos which were good. We had to send something back to the kitchen (not me) due to temperature not being warm enough, but that was quickly rectified    4. Beer: Good! Had their Hefeweizen which was cold and tasty.   Only negative was when the bill for me and my girlfriend's portion came, the waitress had my GF down for 3 big beers instead of the 2 beers she actually ordered. When I brought this to the waitress' attention, she first tried to convince me that she was almost 100% positive my GF had ordered that many beers, however my GF is tiny and she would've been on the floor if she had that many beers in that short amount of time.  Finally the waitress had her manager remove the unordered beer from the bill, but was kind of surprised the waitress argued with us initially.    So I'd go back for the beers, game watching & scenic views.  I'll probably eat elsewhere though before I go.",neutral

My wife would probably give them an additional star because she really like the sweet potato fries.  One good thing about this place is that it is great for a mixed group with lots of food idiosyncracies.  There are a decent number of veggie options, e.g., a mushroom sandwich.",neutral

No noticeable damage caused to my paint so I guess it's okay. However, DO NOT go in here with a traditional, non-retractable antennae or you will not once, but twice watch in horror as you antennae get's bent nearly horizontal and then disappears into the brush. How it survived it beyond me. All that aside, for the price, I feel like my car is no more clean and polished than those $7 laser washes which also do under carriage cleaning. That's why only three stars. Too much hype going on here. More money for same results? No thanks.",neutral

"*3.5 stars*  To the point:  Good food & atmosphere but slow and sometimes hard to get service.   This place opened a bit before I left Toronto so I was excited to finally check it out (I missed those Yelp events...*sad*).  Anyway, I came by here for dinner with a few friends on a weeknight.  It was quiet and never more than a quarter full of diners.   The ambiance is typical downtown-exposed brick (which I really like) and dim lit dining.  Our first server was hard to get a hold of - we had to wait about 15 minutes and then occasionally waving our hand to try to get his attention before we were able to put in our order.  It looked as though he was too busy at the bar chatting.   Service was like that right up to when we tried to flag him down for the bill.  Oh well, at least it gave me ample time to catch up with my friends.  So onward to the food: Deep Fried Calamari (off the tapas menu) - it came with a roasted pepper aioli which was good but tasted a bit on the generic side.  The batter they used for the calamari wasn't very good or maybe they just didn't fry it long enough as the batter was a bit on the soft/non-crispy side.  I would pass on this next time.   Fusili Pasta - sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and sauteed beef in garlic balsamic oil.  This was pretty good and it had a different spin on pasta since it's not the standard tomato or cream sauce.  There was just enough balsamic oil to coat the pasta so it wasn't dry and the beef was tender.  I liked it.   Overall, it was good but I docked half a star for the lackluster service.",neutral

The restaurant is quite striking and in many ways is a homage to Frank Lloyd Wright--very prairiesque in its design.  we sat at the bar--when I got there at 5:30  the wait was a half hour, by later in the evening it had grown to 1.5 hours so, at least now don't consider it if you want a quick bite.  Even at the bar--folks seem to have settled in for the evening --me included--as I was there for almost three hours.  I have to say the wine starts at $9 a glass so if you plan to spend the evening it is not going to be inexpensive--so no so much because of the food--except for the fact that there was one special that was steak and was $40--which I think is somewhat outrageous for this economy  anyway--to get back to the food--I had the club salad--and it was nice--nothing spectacular--i think why I will go back is more for the ambiance of the restaurant it self--service from the bar was okay--they are busy so don't expect a service level that blows your socks off, but I do think they were giving it their best shot.  in spite of it all --there was a nice vibe sitting at the bar that I liked.",neutral

"My husband and I come to Vegas about once a year and usually stay at his parents' timeshare at Planet Hollywood. However, we stayed here this time because the Trop is a Hilton property and he's a Hilton Honors member, so he gets points for the stay. Plus we had a Hilton gift card we had received as a wedding gift that we wanted to use.   Although the casino has recently been redone, it's not nearly as nice as other places we've stayed in Vegas. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, but the decor is really tacky (even for Vegas standards), with lots of neon orange and loud floral prints. We stayed in a ""bungalow"" style room with a ""garden view."" The room itself was clean and pretty basic. I know the style is supposed to be 1950s beach bungalow chic - lots of teak and wicker - but it just makes the rooms look old and dated. Bed is super comfy, though.  Room service is available 24 hours, comes quickly and was pretty tasty. There isn't much shopping in the casino, however. We aren't big gamblers, so I don't have much input on that aspect of things, but there seemed to be plenty of slot machines and game tables.",neutral

"Got denied at the Princess of Wales theatre for the Book of a Mormon lottery so was on the prowl for something delicious to sink my fangs into (I mean teeth)...  Ordered the chicken tandoori kebab - To Go. I was first in line so it couldn't take too too long to receive my food.   Firstly, the place is quite modern. Clean and ample amount of seating.   Bathroom was spotless, which is a nice touch. I used the accessible 'suite' - they take care of this usual issue.   Food arrived - minimum 15 min wait. That means it's fresh...but wait.   Arrived to my post order destination, opened the take out container, andddd...was disappointed.   Firstly - way too much rice. Second - too little meat. Third - too little salad.   Rice was under cooked. Abrasive to the bite. Usually I look forward to the salad but the salad was sloppy and disappointing. Tons of lettuce, little veg, and too much dressing.   The meat - I've had really good BBQ chicken. But have you ever bitten into a chunk of chicken and questioned whether it was cooked or not. That's what I went through tonight. The left side of my brain said don't eat it - but the right side said eat it you fat pig.   Honestly, I won't go back which is a shame. I've been here before and the quality has gone down.",neutral

"We've stayed here three weekends ago and we were stoked about getting a high-end stay and at really good rate. When I was younger, I've envisioned staying at one of these hotels to be like a vintage palace but only to find that wasn't the case.  The rooms were just okay and it was just a standard room.  Really, I was holding my breath before opening the doors thinking yes! a high ballers dream stay! when we opened the doors and turn the lights on then I thought hmmm...similar room like TI's but just slightly above average from that.  We had the fountain view room which was cool, you get a good clear view of the fountain along with the music playing when you have it at a certain channel though your TV. The bed comfort level was okay, spacious bath with tub, decent closet space and of course a flat screen tv.  The biggest cons that bothered us was the room temperature! We set the room control temperature at the lowest setting but we ended up with a not so good night sleep man, we had a warm night! I had to do away those comforters.  The casino level is in decent size, the club atmosphere that friday night was bumping with hoochie mamas waiting to get in The Bank (Club). Next morning only to find no more hoochie mamas but many golfer types and football fanatics during that Super Bowl weekend who were looking to eat or gamble.  Maybe I'm just spoiled from staying at many different hotels, hip, vintage,boutiques, motels you name it, but to pay for a high rate here for me, nah! I'm just glad we stayed here it did satisfied my curiosity and there goes one for my list of collection hotel stays in the Vegas Strip.",neutral

Great room, great views, but the bathroom was not very modern at all.  Still, we had a great time.  The price was so cheap we were able to have another adjoining room for the kids. Wink, wink. Great location, cheap food options, fun pool.  We even got a pizza delivered and ate it in the pool.  Decent cocktail and food prices.  Fun place.

Decided to buy a Keurig thru BBS on October 4th because of their awesome return policy and price with my 20% discount. I had to unfortnantley custom order a Keurig K67 coffee machine because they were out of stock in store. Lady at counter told me I would receive it within 1 week because they were low on inventory. Nearly 3 weeks later after a couple email communications I was informed I would be receiving a refund because they couldn't find K67. I was very mad and losing my patience by this time. I ended up going back to the store and buying a basic model K45 which was in stock from the begining. Instead of getting a refund they processed it as an even exchange which helped.,neutral

Other than the feeling that I was an imposition on their time and life, the hotel is located conveniently to a wealth of stores, foods and services.",neutral
"I've been here several times. The food is a hit or miss, so I'm giving it a 3-star rating.  Atmosphere: It's huge with a casual cafeteria style look for the interior. Great for large parties.  Service: For the last 4 x I was here, the servers were slow to bring our waters, hot sauce etc.  Customers order and pay at the counter.  Food: The appetizers are amazing from the hummus, Moutabbal (Grilled eggplant with tahini sauce), manakeesh (Middle-Eastern pizza), and huge house-made pitas. There are tons of desserts worth getting.   The mains however are just ok. I've had really dry chicken shwarma dinner in the past, but enjoyed the beef shwarma plate.  I enjoy the selection on the menu but wish the mains were more consistent.",neutral

Stopped by over the weekend for some lunch and was quite surprised. The food was delicious. I had a turkey burger and my husband had one of their grilled cheese sandwiches. Both were wonderful. They had a good selection of beer on tap as well. The only downside was despite them not being super busy the service was lacking. We were never given napkins or utensils and our waitress didn't come back until we asked for our check. Disappointing but the food alone can keep at least 3 stars. May try it again in hopes the service is better.,neutral
"The pizza is delicious! Especially the white one. Perfect spot for a quick bite to end a night of fun in Vegas... But I am leaving 3 stars because of the service.

"I like Union Grill. The food is fresh and tasty, the atmosphere is cute and the service is good. I have no complaints, but it did not impress me enough to warrant more than three stars. I liked the variety of the menu and the veggies tasted fresh. This isn't the first place I would go looking for a healthy meal, but I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were steamed without oil and the sweet potato that I had for my side was plain. As with most places, just order carefully to lighten up your meal. My table ordered a $10 bottle of Bordeaux and it was good! All in all, a good experience and I would go back if I happened to be in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to make a return trip.",neutral

I will land in the middle of Andrea K and Gabi K.  The hotel was gorgeous and great for people watching for sure!  At the ground floor was a lounge area called 'The Living Room' we had a very pricey drink although mine was good others had to send theirs back.  We were lucky that we were on the lists or I would have been feeling like Andrea mentioned in her review.  This is not Hollywood or New York this is Scottsdale people... get a grip on yourself and where you are.  There is no need to make people feel like they are not welcome... for that reason alone I was not that impressed with this place.  Once upstairs we walked around and checked the scene out.  They have a great pool area with very comfy looking lounge chairs... a small bar by the pool and another large one right when you first get upstairs.  I went to the smaller one to 'try' and get a drink... I think I was ignored for about 10 minutes or so till I finally said something and got a mediocre mixed drink that was not cheap either.  I cannot say that I wont be back for a drink again... maybe when the hype dies down.,neutral

"Americano is an espresso with hot water.  Not a brewed cup 'o joe.  But that's what the guy gave me.  After we left for Fez (consistently great and fun since, um many years?) I called Lux and left a message.  She called the next day saying they're getting the kinks out and offered another if my wife and I give them another chance.  So an extra star for that.  Very nice place with oppressive levels of hipsters.  Which is either fun or off-putting depending on how you're wired.  Though it is nice to not have a single Ed Hardy in the entire place.  As other reviewers have noted, the menus & drink lists written on clear glass are difficult to read.  And you have to find where they are.  Food looked yummy though.

"During this visit, I only tried a few things so I'm open to coming again to try other dishes and add to my review later on.  They have a huge selection so lots to choose from.    Food: Ordered 3 things: Oyster slider burgers, lobster roll and soft shell crab seafood fried rice.  We liked the oyster slider burgers the best in terms of texture and taste.  It was unique and we enjoyed it.  The lobster roll was also very fresh and delicious.  However, the lobster roll was pretty small and it came with sides that were nothing special.  The soft soft shell crab seafood rice was a good idea and we could taste the crunchy bits of sot shell crab but other than that, it was just normal fried rice.  It was okay but no wow factor.  Perhaps, we didn't choose the right dishes.  Maybe next time, I'll try the other side of the menu to try their seafood ""boil"" options.    Service:  Great atmosphere, spacious and comfortable seating. Great for coming with a group of friends to sample more dishes and also to just hang out or watch a games from their many TVs.  Service was prompt and attentive.",neutral

Pork and chicken tacos are served with refried beans and rice. Again, good, but nothing amazing.

Dry and not seasoned well not fond of it , the tomato sauce taste nothing special I added quite a bit of grounded black pepper so it won't taste so plain . It was ciabatta bread sliced toasted with garlic oil artisan bread I guess they source it out in a close by bakery . I tried very hard to finish my meal ...sorry to say .

"Love the atmosphere of this diner, definitely one of my favorites! Great coffee. The food is quite heavy though, and hash browns are greasy and not the tasty-est. Always feel like falling asleep after eating their breakfasts (not ideal before work but great for a weekend hangover cure!) a few more lighter options/gluten free options/ etc would be good.

"Just had a quick lunch at this location near NorthLake Mall.  You know for a chain BBQ jiont, it is great.  Actually, chain or not it rivals many here in Charlotte.    I had the combo sampler platter with pork, ribs and chicken tenders,  I admit tenders are an odd item for a BBQ place perhaps.  But these are the biggest tenders I have seen.  A choice of sauces or grilled if you prefer.  Very good.  The pork was juicy and tender, the ribs fork tender and full of flavor.  But the ribs seemed to be more steamed or something like that rather than cooked low and slow on a smoker.  Sides were good too.  VERY cheesey M&C.  Yum.  The platter was pretty big too.  Maybe too big for lunch. I'm stuffed.  In and out in 30 minutes with friendly service.    Sure you could find better BBQ joints but this one won't be a bad one any time.",neutral

"Made reservations here for my wife's birthday.   We decided to go with the chefs tasting menu.  First let me state the the service was excellent. However the food left some to be desired.  1.) Beet Salad: 4/5 Goat cheese and beets were good, duck confit was dry. 2.) Seared Scallops: 3/5 Scallops were cooked correctly, however the broth they came in was completely flavorless 3,) Pasta w/short rib: 3.5/5 Pasta was cooked perfectly however the cream sauce was bland and there was barely and short rib. 4.) Filet: 2/5: Filet was cooked perfectly however there was a foam sauce all over it that was EXTREMELY SALTY and almost inedible.  5.) Dessert: 3/5: Dessert was a standard chocolate pie of some sort, it was ok. Seemed like it was just defrosted and not made in house.  Overall the food was OK, however for how expensive this place is, I can think of 20 other places in Cleveland I would rather go. I won't be returning here.",neutral

"So to start out with, I'm like, incredibly lazy. I mean it's ridiculous. So the idea of a movie theater where I could sit there and press a button and have all my food and drink served to me was such an awesome concept I knew it would go really well with Jurassic Park 3D. PS: Those dinosaurs still look so awesome.   We get there and the front desk girl was really nice and when we got upstairs they gave us a menu and we went to our chairs. I noticed a couple of things here: The cup holder is awkwardly placed. I want it next to my face so I don't have to reach over in the darkness to put my cup away and hope to god I don't drop it. The tables weren't so great if you had to use the bathroom during the movie. Which I totally did so I experienced that level of awkwardness myself.   The food is okay, my friends salad was a weird combination of salads and my coconut chicken tenders were pretty solid. The service was so weird though. Like, I wasn't sure if all the people were brand new or what. They came to take our order a couple of times before they realized someone else had taken it. My coke refill took for freaking ever. Seriously. We got our check halfway through the movie so that was a genius moment on our part since everyone else had to hang out during the credits to pay.   So by all means go and enjoy, but enjoy it a little less than if you had just gone to a restaurant and a cheaper movie theater. You could probably even just sneak in some vodka and it would still be cheaper.  Oh and they validate parking but if theres a dude standing there asking you to fork over 10 dollars to park then they don't validate. I told him I would just parallel park and I parked for like 4 hours for free so if theres a lesson anywhere it's to parallel park people. The spaces here are ridiculous huge. It's not even that hard.",neutral

"I hate giving a diner a 3/5 but I had to. The food was excellent but the service was not. Had high hopes because the Avenue Diner that was here previously rocked it.  I love breakfast. I had the scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, sausage and toast. Pretty basic, but delish.   Atmosphere is simple, low volume but man oh man, we thought we were being poached alive (and it's not hot outside).  Service was less than desirable. I think with training, they could rock it. Be more personal and it will make people want to come back. Just a word of advice.  I think this is a case of ""been there, done that"" for me. I can always find diners to rock breakfast.",neutral
"Let me start by saying I love Tapas restaurants. And Spanish tapas are my favorite. This restaurant has a nice decor. The theme of the tapas are more Mediterranean to eastern European than spanish.

The first dish we tried the hummus con Carne was excellent. The last a seared peppers was just plain weird. But the sauce was nice. I probably won't be back, by t it was nice to try.

"Staying at the Nugget and looking for a nice dinner close by. Went to the Grotto around 6 on Monday. No reservation needed, although the place started filling up an hour later.   Service was a little spotty at first, but got better as the meal progressed. The fresh bread and seasoned olive oil was excellent. I had the Pollo Francese, which was just slightly overdone, but still good. My wife had  the Shrimp Griglia, which she liked. Just enough garlic to require a stick of gum after, but not enough to taste the next morning!  The best deal of the night was a Rigatoni Bolognese special for $10. Two of our friends ordered that dish, and they both felt they got their money's worth.   One disappointment is the inability to order a side salad with dinner. One of our party asked, and she was directed to the main salad menu, starting at $10. Missed opportunity, folks. You likely would have sold several salads at $5, but instead we kept asking for the free bread.   If you're looking for an easy, somewhat upscale alternative to standard downtown fare, the Grotto is a nice go-to in a pinch.",neutral
"Overall a spacious place to do work or read a good book. Outlets available in very convenient places!  I ordered a honey and lavender latte and got a slice of the pumpkin chocolate chip bread. I thought the latte seemed a bit pricy at first, but you get a good amount for $4.25 (small). I was a bit disappointed, however, because the latte was super sweet to the point where I had to get a glass of water to drink with it. I was not even  of the way through before I didn't really want to drink it anymore. Pumpkin chocolate chip bread was soft and tasty, but also aired on the too-sweet side.   Looks like they have a big selection of fresh food items too. I'll have to try that next time!",neutral

They do pride them self on the variety of spring rolls they offer, which I found to be nothing special but not bad. So all in all its OKAY, plain and simple.",neutral

"We came here for Winterlicious $48 three-course dinner as the restaurant is a new addition this year. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff are all dressed up in matching outfits.   An important point to note. Upon looking at photos of other customers who went to Winterlicious earlier, the plating was what caught my eye. They used plates with elegant blue floral designs. I was disappointed as I only received a plain white plate for my dessert. The man beside my table received the blue plate that I kept seeing in the photos, he ordered before I did.  We ordered the following:    App: - Dorade Ceviche (milk aioli, lime, sepia dressing, escarole, shoestring potatoes) This was the best dish. The fish was fresh and nicely paired iwth the sauce. It was also topped with shoestring potatoes (which reminded me of Hickory sticks).   Mains: - Chitarrine a la amatriciana (clams, egg noodles, guanciale, tomato sauce, reggianito, chili)  This was disappointing. It seemed like something you would get at a restaurant that prices it for cheaper. The sauce was a bit spicy but the sauce was a bit too salty. - Eggplant Milanesa (northern woods mushroom and chickpea stew, green olives, red wine sauce) This was interesting. The eggplant was fried and was plated on top of the chickpea stew. The flavours were flavourful, but nothing spectacular.   Dessert: - Candied Orange & Almond Cake (marmalade syrup, sour cream ice cream) The cake was very dry and dense. The marmalade syrup helped to lighten it, but it was still not the best. The sour cream ice cream was unique however, and I enjoyed it.   Verdict: I will not go back again. The food is not anything too amazing. For the price of what I'm paying, there are many other places you can go to.",neutral

Here is a place close to the house that we frequent more when the weather is warmer. They have a nice area outside to sit and relax. The food is decent enough but not all that special. There isn't a large menu but there is a bit of seafood or steak if that is your desire. The burgers are big and you can replace your fries with a nice chopped salad. The drinks are priced well below places like Applebee's or Chili's so enjoy one with your meal. Would I rave about this place? Clearly not but it is not like a dive bar so you can bring a lady without worry. Check it out and then come back and correct this review if you feel it is in error. You won't change my opinion but maybe someone else's and good luck  wit dat!!,neutral

"Upon arriving in an extremely cold 34 degrees day in Las Vegas, my sister-in-law, brought us here to eat lunch. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes in line, we were finally seated and allowed to explore and eat our hearts out. Knowing how carbs can quickly fill me up, I went straight for the good ol' BBQ protein and meat section (only because they did not serve crab legs for lunch). I got their chicken, ribs, kielbasa sausage and prime rib. It was OK at best. After that first plate, I went to the fried stuff, hush puppies, onion rings and other fried foods that I can't even remember. After scarfing my second food of plate, I decided to take a break and assess how much more food I can take. After a few minutes, I decided to take a stroll to the lines of food one last time. I wanted to try some pastas and Italian foods but it looked so messy that I resisted the urge. Their Asian food section had the traditional westernized Asian food so I stayed away from them as well, I decided to take some cocktail shrimps which were surprisingly good, but not great. Finally, I went to get my main meal of the day:desserts. I got the tiramisu and cookies and cream gelato, and some other sweet treats which, again, was OK. The only other thing I thought was good was that my drink was always filled every time I came back from getting another plate of food. I'm really glad that my expectations with buffets wasn't that high because this place was OK at best. Thus the 3 star rating...",neutral

The four pancakes were huge - thick and large diameter.  Sadly the quality was only fair; they were heavy.  However, the link sausage was good: crispy, chewy skin, and juicy meat.  The bill: $20.  I returned to the scene of the crime during another trip.  It was four in the morning, I hadn't had dinner yet (playing craps can do that to you), and I was hungry.  I settled for French Toast that was decent: four large, thick slices of eggy bread, fried until brown.  This still wouldn't be my first choice for a place to eat, but it will do in a pinch.",neutral

"I like to go to the Hotel spas just to get a day pass for the facilities and relax especially when i stay there.  Spas usually give the ""luxury relaxation"" vibe- this Spa was a bit different.  The Spa here was a tad outdated, it was in need of some modern TLC. The facilities were kept fairly clean but it lacked the amenities of other spas.   When i entered, i was given a metal bucket filled with ice a chilled towel and some oranges in a plastic bag (?!) Come to find out a lot of these standard things that are in spas aren't put out here....in addition there was no bottled water and you had to have the attendant pour water into a plastic cup for you every time, there were no individually wrapped combs or brushes, just the used ones in the creepy blue solution with hairs still stuck in it.   The Shower heads here were the saving grace, they were awesome, but the peeling paint in the shower's ceiling and the loose and grimy bath gel pumps within the shower took away from it.   Between the 2 hot tubs was a loud TV blaring sports....if they dimmed the lights and pumped in tranquil spa music instead it'd have a totally new feel.  I'm glad i only paid a $10 entry fee, but with a little more attention to detail and simple things done to change the ambiance it'd be better.

"I remember eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory when I was a little kid and I remembered that I LOVED it! So I was very excited for the new location to open in Chandler and I knew that I would definitely be by for a visit! I went to this location for the first time with my parents. We ordered an appetizer, the Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread (absolutely amazing!) and we each got a different entrΓ©e. My dad loves spicy food, so he ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius, which ended up not being spicy at all. My mom got the spaghetti with marinara sauce, which had absolutely no flavor. I got the spaghetti with the rich meat sauce which was tasty, but it could have had more flavor to it as well. Of course the spumoni ice cream for dessert was delicious. But we were not that impressed by the flavors of the food. I think I remembered that I loved the food so much because I was little and I didn't like spice. I think that the food items here are much better for children. On another occasion, we ordered OSF food for takeout while we were working. We got macaroni and cheese, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and the garlic cheese bread.. it was unanimous that the best thing out of all of those was the garlic cheese bread... needless to say we aren't going to be doing trade-outs with them anymore at work.",neutral

"Hey Las Vegas Yelpers!  So... I've been living in Vegas for 2 months now. Been here twice on a Monday, both visits were decent. First visit I rolled in with my friends who are promoters (for another venue), they had a table by the main stage and my second visit was this past Monday for yelp night and we had 2 tables in the back room. Both times I didn't have to wait in a line or pay to get in (and if I did, then I wouldn't waste my time trying to get into Jet or any other venue).  Decent size nightclub. Nothing is really wrong with this venue... but compared to other glamorous nightclubs on the strip... Jet is just ""another nightclub"". When I visited Vegas over the past years... I never came to Jet. But now as a local and people I know come here... I don't mind coming to Jet....    Would I recommend anyone coming to Jet? Only if you're staying at the Mirage and don't want to travel, sure. Otherwise... I rather dance the night away somewhere else (don't want to drop other venue names in this review).  Jet in my books is just A-Ok. Jet doesn't make my hit list of must go toos. But if you're just looking for a nightclub to party at and not picky about the ambiance or DJ... hit up JET :)) you can't go wrong.  Self parking is never a problem!  Enjoy!",neutral

Came in to watch the Steelers game (they were away this weekend). The hostess was very pleasant. We ordered the gravy fries with cheese curds as an appetizer. It was great. I sampled a couple IPAs while my girl friend had a berry flavored beer from a local microbrewery. She ordered French toast for brunch while I went with the house burger with garlic Parmesan fries. She said the French toast was very good.  My burger was cooked right and was good. The fries were a let down as they seem to use powdered cheese. Our waitress seemed like she had better things to do because about 20 seconds after we sat down she asked what we wanted to order. I hadn't even had time to open the beer list (they have 39 taps). We asked for more time and she seemed annoyed by it. I would go back for the food and he beer but if was sat in her section again I would just go sit at the bar instead.,neutral

"I have mixed feeling about my experience. The movers were very nice and courteous. The negative feeling came from the fact that I was quoted for an initial 4 hours and the move ended up taking 11 hours. We were charged for the entire 11 hours which I can only assume included time for lunch/breaks. The truck was not big enough so they also had to take 2 trips which transit time alone took almost an extra hour. Performance wise I don't have any major complaints. There were some occasions where I saw one person took 1 boxes at a time which I thought could be more efficient. But really in the end I just wish the estimate could have been much closer. I was prepared for the move to take 1-2 hours more than what's estimated, but was definitely not prepared for it to take almost 3 times longer. I would have been better off hiring an additional moving services because a second truck and 3 more movers could complete the job much lower cost than what we ended up paying.",neutral

"Thumbs up: good prices, a tad cheaper than some of the other options in the area. Fresh toppings and this spicy pickled something (garlic and eggplant maybe?) was especially good.  Thumbs down: Menu inside is quite different from the pamphlets they give out. Some of the options on the pamphlet aren't actually available (i.e. Donair (Beef &Lamb) wrap/sandwich  Schwarmas. How do you differentiate between them? Imho, you need some good, distinctive toppings. The main components of Lezzet's Chicken schawarma is good, but fairly run of the mill. The veggies were fresh and the sauces were mostly average. There was one topping, a spicy pickled veggie that was particularly distinctive, it added a nice kick to the pita, but it doesn't quite add enough to put this place over the top compared to Pita and Grill which is up the street. It's a toss up between the two.  The prices are a bit lower than other options in the area and the restaurant is clean. Chicken Schawamra pita came to $5.50 after taxes. See pictures for additional pricing.  If you're looking for it, it's in the corner of the plaza ACROSS from Rockwood mall.",neutral

"I am torn between three and four stars.  I want to give them six stars for the superb food, but the service is extremely lacking.    My husband and I have been to Tako twice.  The first time was an utter disaster with our appetizer forgotten, and ordered more takos to make up for it at the end.  My husband and our table were sprayed with water coming from the soda gun at the bar.  Our waiter was only concerned about the cute girls beside us.  We were practically ignored. The manager finally came over when we said don't bring us more takos just let us leave.  The manager was completely appropriate and gave us our meal with tacos to go.  It was quiet a while before we tried it again.  It wasn't as bad as the first visit, but still sub-par service. The second round, after being there for thirty minutes I couldn't get my waitress's attention to ask for more water.  She did not make eye contact with me.  Even when I am walking in and out of the restaurant, the staff does not even stop to let me through as they must be more important than I am.  I just do not understand this mentality.   However..... the tacos are so freaking good.  The Tako taco is so delicious with the most perfectly cooked octopus I have ever eaten (not chewy, which is so hard to do)! The octopus is complemented with delicious lemon vinegarette and crispy chickpeas, OMG!!! Cannot get enough.  The other tacos we had were also delicious including lamb barbacoa and duck.  So good!! Plus the guacamole: chorizo and goat cheese.  We almost licked the bowl.     YUM YUM YUM!  But I will probably get take-out takos from here on out.  Delicious food without the subpar hipster we are too good for you servers.",neutral
"Easily one of the most overrated burgers I've had in my life. I can't handle more than a slice of American 'cheese', so that seems to knock off a good portion of the menu (I'm looking at you, ""double double""). Their beef is pretty darn good, but good luck savoring that, as it's overwhelmed by what is practically a salad between the buns. At least they're toasted to perfection.  Also, the fries blow. Yeah yeah, there's no trans fat! They're freshly cut potatoes! DGAF, it's not like anyone has health or freshness on the mind at a fast food joint. The novelty of the great ingredients wears off when you realize every item is the same. Ooh, animal style...who can actually finish off that monstrosity? Who would *want* to?  I stick with something simple. A nice hamburger with grilled onions. It leaves me content, but not anywhere near the foodgasm I hear California transplants raving about.  The pros: -Clean -Open lobby 'til 1AM -Quality ingredients  The bad: -15 minutes for one damned hamburger -No variety (unless you feel like adding more fat) -Fries are lackluster -Thousand Island or GTFO   They WOULD get two stars, but their business practices are too groovy for that.

"Inexpensive, large portions, and decent-to-good food.  I've been here four times now, and we've had some inconsistencies from one visit to another.  The food has always been at least decent, but often quite good, the portions are almost always large, and I'm usually surprised by how little we've paid at the end.  We've had the Peking Duck here three times, and the first time it was pretty nice, the subsequent time our first course was mostly skin, and the third time was somewhere in between.  I certainly wouldn't suggest that you consider this the best Peking Duck in the city, or even within a half-hours drive, but it's here, it's decent, and it's not terribly expensive.  We've had three different congees here, and the House Super Bowl and the Fresh Scallop congees were both quite good, where the Lobster Super Bowl Congee was a disappointment.  We've also had the mixed meat chow mein twice, and I have to admit I have a soft spot for stir fried noodles that are cooked hard like these.  The 'assorted meat' includes a fair number of organ meats, so if that's not your thing, I'd pick something different.  Is it exceptional?  No.  But it's reasonably good and reasonably priced.",neutral

"Our food was outstanding but everything else was just ""meh.""  We came here early around 5:30 (hiking all the way up to Tom's dang Thumb will make you ravenous for the rest of the day!) but were told all the empty tables were being held for reservations. We were offered spots at the bar or to take seats at their ""communal tables""...I'm usually fine with communal tables, since they're long and spaced out for parties. These were two separate 6 tops. We had another couple join the table in the middle of our meal and it was just...weird. At least join the two together to space people out? I noticed at least two other parties walk in, say they didn't have a reservation, but then get seated at a table. Huh.  Anyway, we wait way too long for our server to greet us. She apologized, but we were about to walk out. (See previous review re: Fox RC's being the only ones to do it right, which is so odd to me.) Luckily, the food was great. The hummus board is a work of art, and all the veggies were drizzled with pesto and local honey. It was such a great, beautiful version of a hummus appetizer. I opted for the half chicken, which was served with some more of the same roasted veggies and smashed, roasted fingerlings. It was all delicious, as was my husband's braised short rib over risotto. The wait between our appetizer and main course was, again, way too long.  We spent over $100 for dinner, and were just a little underwhelmed by everything but the food. Probably a pass in the future. But kudos to the kitchen.",neutral

I got the electric strawberry, enchilada, and the Beijing.   With the enchilada I was not impressed at all. I thought it was really really lacking flavor. The wing itself though was big and meaty. The electric strawberry reminded me of the strawberry jelly that you put on top of your ice cream but with a spicy kick. This flavor really wasn't for me but it wasn't bad. Out of the three  that I tried I would have to say the Beijing was probably my favorite. It had really nice big chunks of garlic witch I liked.    To be honestly I probably wouldn't order any of these three flavors again. But i really want to try every flavor you guys have. My server was super nice, friendly and attentive.

"We had to check this out while I'm Phoenix because it was rated so highly of Trip Advisor. The design is great as everyone gets their own set of headphones and the music automatically starts playing when you walk up to each exhibit but this place definitely isn't for everyone. If you're really into music and history, you'll love it.. but if you're not then you'll become bored pretty quickly. I wish there were more exhibits that featured modern day musicians and less of the different countries because although interesting, they all were so similar. I wouldn't recommend bringing young children here because there's only one room where they allow you to touch the instruments and the rest of the exhibits aren't the most child friendly. Although it was interesting to see once, for me once was enough. Again if you have a strong interest in music history, you will love it..but if you're only somewhat interested like me then you'll get bored pretty quickly.",neutral

"Was taken to lunch at Sweet Mahal the other day by a couple of co-workers. I chose the veg-thali plant, which seems to be much larger than others. For only $8.99, it was quite a good deal and so yummy.  I chose a potato dish, chick peas and okra. All very well spiced and flavourful. Came with 2 huge pieces of naan, choice of plain or garlic.   We also ordered some veg pakoras for appetizers. I found them to be a bit drier than normal and very salty. And overall, the food temperature could have been a lot warmer.",neutral

"The outside patio is nice and overlooks the TI pirate show.  The wait staff were attentive, but forgot to bring the edamame.  Once we ordered our food it came out in about 5 minutes which was extremely rushed.  This may be because the restaurant was completely dead at 730PM on a Sunday evening.  The Sushi was just ok and the Maguro sushi in their house sauce was good but not worth $25 for the thin slivers and not enough sauce.  This would probably be a good place to go with friends, but I don't feel it is worth the money at least for the quality of the food.",neutral

"We decided to try the lunch special - a personal 10'' pizza with soup or salad.  Hubby got the Cesar salad, I chose the turkey chili.  Both were a supreme disappointment.  Who puts celery in Cesar salad?!  Apparently Humble Pie does.  And the turkey ""chili"" was anything but ... more like a Minestrone soup with globs of unpeeled grape tomatoes.  Yuck.  The saving grace here was definitely the pizza.  Brick oven cooked, the crust was perfection.  We both got the meat-lovers with red onion - - toppings were generous and the mozzarella was fresh. REALLY good pizza.    Service was lacking ... it was a good 15 minutes before we were served our salad and ""chili"" and the pizza quickly followed about 5 minutes later.  We weren't provided with cheese or peppers (even though we asked) until we were halfway finished with the pizza.  There were only 3 other tables in the restaurant at the time with 2 servers, so the delay seemed unacceptable.    If you go to Humble Pie, skip everything but the pizza.  You'll be glad you did.",neutral
"The bartender was nice and interactive, in other words the service was great but the actual drinks were overpriced for the amount that you got. The drinks themselves are strong, but the overpowering taste of the alcohol takes away from the flavor that you asked for. For example the peppermint martini was nothing but alcohol and sweet thick peppermint syrup mixed together. I was not a fan. The Reese's one was also too strong.",neutral

Aside from that the upstairs bar is average and I think they tell you it's going to be an hour long wait for bowling to force you to spend money on food and drinks.

"We came here for dinner on a stop through town. The menu and ambience looked attractive. They also have a nice patio to sit outside, albeit in a parking lot. The overall positive aspects were fast service on a Saturday night, fresh ingredients and tasty flavors. However, the ribs were over cooked and chewy. While the mussels were hit or miss with some not really hot and the accompanying fries completely soaked in the broth. I'd have preferred to get them on the side and not buried underneath the shells.",neutral

"Always a just ok experience. I wish they took reservations because it is always busy around dinner time. Had a party of 4 and we sat at the bar for an hour before we got a table. When we got a table and ordered our food, I wanted double noodles and made it very clear to the waiter that I still wanted rice. When the cook came out and verified everyone's orders, he told me I ordered no rice. I had to clarify my order 3 times. I hope the chef gets most of the tip because our waiter wasn't that great. Didn't even box our food like the other servers do or ask us for a refill on our drinks.",neutral

Waitress displayed very little effort with checking on us, refilling drinks, etc.  Not sure if we will be back.",neutral

"It's 30 bucks for a mani/pedi here, which I saw on the sign outside while driving home from work. ""Ok"", I told myself ""if there's a parking spot within the block, I'll go try it out."" There was, so I did. I'm not usually one to try out a nail spot before hearing reviews, which I why I wish I had read up on them on Yelp before heading inside.   You definitely get what you pay for with this place. After choosing my polish, I sat in one of their chairs. The massage-chair controllers were wrapped in dirty saran-wrap which was my first clue about the general cleanliness of the place.   The actual pedicure was well done. She payed attention to my callused heels and cuticles, but I was worried about how clean her tools were the whole time. She finished up the pedicure with a foot and leg massage, which was unexpected (I thought I would be rushed out for sure) and was given paper slippers so I could walk over to the manicure table.  The manicure was done by the same girl. No chit-chat, just a quick (and I mean QUICK) no-frills buff and polish with some cuticle trimming. A hand massage followed, which I could have done without; the cream she used was really floral and bothered my nose. I would ask them not to use it if I ever go back.  This is definitely a two-stars kind of place, but I gave it three because I got what I expected. You can tell from the look of this place (and the price) that it is not going to be fancy, nor the most sterile. I'll go back if I find myself needing a quicky on a budget, but I think I'd rather spend an extra $10 - $15 and go somewhere I feel more comfortable and clean.",neutral

"I was never a fan of AYCE sushi. Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot! However, we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here, so I finally got to see what it was all about. So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet.   A few things I would like to point out..... First, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.  Second, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!  Lastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do.   Anyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you. I don't mind paying more for sushi that I can definitely enjoy elsewhere!",neutral

I ordered a dish with shrimp in it, and told the waitress that I would like extra shrimp. She told me there was a surcharge, which I saw on the menu there would be, but I couldn't figure out what the dish would have looked like WITHOUT the bonus shrimp!  And by Thai standards, the eggplant with shrimp dish was just ... bland!  Here's something tragically funny: On the window facing the parking lot, the large letters proclaim ""THAI FOOD AT BEST"". I thought it was a typo (Thai food at ITS best), but it turns out that it was correct the first time!",neutral

"You get what you pay for. This used to be a good sushi AYCE restaurant but they had to revise their business model to compete with new AYCE places opening in downtown Toronto.  Lunch and dinner are both fairly priced and they serve really fast. Salad and soup usually come 2 minutes after ordering and kitchen food come within 5 minutes. With that said, the quality of the rolls and sushi have declined over the years with fish being not so fresh and the rice will be warm.  Overfall you get a nice full meal, good place for hanging out with friends.",neutral

"Staying at the Mirage so I decided to give this place a try. Since I was going solo I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was engaging even though he was busy, explained the menu and recommendation on drinks. I ordered the Rodizio, which is basically an all you can eat grilled meat selection with sides. It's apparently brought to you on a skewer and put on a platter (I was at the bar so I got a platter of meat).   I order some ginormous drink called a Caipirinha (actually I had 2) and it kicked my butt pretty good. I went on to gamble away 50 bucks in the casino without hesitation and called it a night.   Anyway, the food was good, got a bit loud because of a group of frat boys, good selection of meats from chicken to lamb to marinated steak and some sides of veges (creamed spinach, carrots, rice & beans). The bill was $80, but I did have a good amount to drink. Worth a try. -Dan O.",neutral

The food was OK. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just Mexican food, you know?  Walking out of this restaurant, I feel like a man for once in my life. I took a selfie with La Santissima in the background and sent it to my friends.   When I was walking to my car a homeless person slapped the glasses out of my face...I mean I didn't need them to see, those were sunglasses. I probably shouldn't have worn them at night anyway.
