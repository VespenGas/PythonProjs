"The new location is way bigger than the original one. And that's the best thing about this place. Once we sat down, it took us 25 min to get hold of the server. Then after another 50 minutes, the food arrived. Not a huge order. 2 karahis, naan and tawwa keema. The tawwa keema was a complete flop. Keema was chunky and tasteless. No sign of smoke flavour. Karahi was good. But not the same taste as their original location. Something is different. However, it is still good. But it is not worth the wait. There were only 2 or 3 servers. It's 7-8 times bigger in size, but still the same number of people serve. But unfortunately it's not their fault. They can serve only what's cooked and provided. To wait almost an hour for 2 karahis is ridiculous. Won't be coming back. Either I'm going to old location or finding another place for my karahi fix."
"Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices.  Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine.  I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.  I didn't get the chance to sample any of their dozen or so brews, but it looked like a solid selection. They brew their own sodas, as well."
i was feeling listless from the need of new things something different
i love you guys sooooo much and i hope you all feel his love his peace his tender mercies in your life and you can seek to reach out to everyone around you
ive been a mess all week and i feel helpless sometimes
i then discovered that when i shared this with others despite my feelings of being vulnerable raw exposed and freaking out about what others would think it suddenly didnt matter anymore and i realised that the world wasnt going to end
i always need some space to modify my feelings and if i talk i ll talk without a brain supporting me
i get the feeling youve been punished enough
i think i deserve for once this freedom makes me feel amazing
im feeling mellow i would probably listen to pink floyds animals or the wall two of my most favorite albums
"Chicago magazine featured Nostrano 2 years ago and I've been wanting to try them ever since. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. My husband and I went here with another couple for dinner last night and I can't say we had a great experience.  First off we all ordered a cocktails and the salumi board to start with. We also wanted to order the scallops, but they were out so we decided to order the snapper crudo instead.   Drinks arrived and they were good. Interesting and refreshing, but not amazing. I can't remember the name of my drink but it had cucumber and gin and it was just a little off balance for my taste (too heavy on the sweet/cucumber). But my husband loved one of his. Unfortunately, one of the other people we were with did not like hers at all and never drank any of it.  The salumi board was great and a bunch of different wonderful meats to try and a nice pickled vegetable salad. The pate on the board was especially stellar. The crudo was just ok. The snapper itself isn't a very flavorful fish, but the ingredients it was paired with was nice. Unfortunately I got an extremely chewy piece and that kind of turned me off of eating any more of it.  My husband ordered the rabbit boudin blanc and confit and he gave me a bite of his nettle gnocchi that came with it and that was AWESOME. Perfect texture, creamy rich taste, delicious. I ordered the lamb ragu pappardelle and while I can totally recognize that it was a fantastic dish, it was spicy. There was definitely nothing on the menu to indicate that (though on the online menu I see now it lists harissa, it doesn't say that in house, it says cinnamon instead which is ""spicy,"" but not in the same way) and unfortunately it was too spicy for me to really eat and enjoy my whole dish. My friend ordered the tagliatelle with walnut pesto and she really didn't like it so I offered to trade her my lamb ragu since it was too spicy. But hers was oddly bitter (probably from the rye and radicchio) so I didn't get far there either.  In the end we left with a $200 bill and one drink completely not drunk and two dishes of pasta only eaten about 20% of the way. Pretty big bummer. The guys were happy, and my husband loved every single dish and would probably rate this place much higher than I, but I left hungry and disappointed. :("
i want some chicken and dumplings im learning to say yes maam and yes sir without feeling like im being rude by acting like a smarty pants
i might be feeling like i m called to be the sweet little stay at home wife mom and cook for everyone since i spend most of my time in the kitchen anyway
i feel like im being a terrible person and that hes going to hate me for thinking these things

i couldnt help but close my eyes feeling his hand on my face oddly peaceful him doing that
I came here for lunch. I asked if they deliver the guy working said no. Then I saw there fly witch says they deliver. The service is okay not slow and not fast. The employee are not rude nor are they friendly. It was in a word blah service. However the cheese stake was good. 1 give the food a 4 and the service a 2
i feel our diets are not so rich as it used to be for people of earlier times

i never want her to feel the pain of struggle of suffering
i sat there feeling so amazed that i actually found great joy in such simple things
"I came here for lunch on a weekday.  It was very crowded!  We were lucky enough to get outdoor seating though.  I ordered the caprese bruchetta and a side green salad.  The bruchetta was a little oily for me... also very garlicy.  If I were to go back, I think I would stick with a caprese salad or sandwich instead for those flavors. The salad was good too, pretty big and fairly plain.  My friends both got pizzas that they thought were excellent.  This is a great lunch place I would definitely revisit."
i was feeling a bit gloomy over the weekend maybe it was all these grey days weve been having
i guess since im feeling a bit less shitty have a random picture
i feel like inserting a romantic quote here just because i m kinda overflowing with this fluffy romantic stuff right now but i don t know how to word it right
i want to feel special and look special
"Three stars is actually quite the win for Bata considering the low expectations that i went in with, and speaks highly to Bata's credibility as a museum, even when the customer doesn't much of an interest in the subject matter (in my case, my significant other was very much looking forward to it, and probably would give it a 4-5 star review if she was authoring this review).  The most interesting segment for me was the history of the shoe, although i would have appreciated a bit more of a linear narrative - i struggled to tie some of the areas into the greater history.    The exhibit on the dangers of shoes and fashion throughout the years (arsenic dyes, anyone) was also fairly engaging.  Wish we could have seen it during the 'pay what you choose' night, as i did think the price was a bit on the high side given the size of the museum.  I believe there is a deal where you can also gain admission to the textile and a third museum for a small amount more, but neither of the other two interested us."
i mean im an omnivore because i know that plants feel just as much pain as the animals and were less considerate of that so i see no reason to exclude based on feeling
im finding it tough to strike a balance between staying cool telling you things which bother me and not letting you feel that im being uptight which eventually leads to more and more lying or hiding of the truth
i feel dumb for even liking you
i have been continually surprised at how much less i need to eat to feel truly satisfied if im eating good food and sitting down for a whole lovely little experience at each meal satisfying the soul as well as the stomach
i find myself as i may have mentioned feeling slightly more sympathetic to le pen

"First place on my tour of Cleveland, thanks to my buddy Patrick.  This was my first Pho experience, and it was-as the three-star rating might suggest- A-OK.  All of us got a combo meal, which included a Vietnamese sandwich, and all but one of us got the Pho.  I chose the flank steak.  It had an interesting appearance, looked and tasted a little bit stringy.  Everything else about the soup was ok, and I like that they include a bunch of stuff on the side that you can add the way you like, such as sweet basil, bean sprouts, and some extra hot jalapeΓ±os.  Add in some sriracha hot sauce, and the soup was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy.  The jasmine hot tea was a good choice to complement the meal.  And for the amount of money ($10 or so), you get a ton of food.  Cons:  If you're white or inexperienced in Pho like myself, there's not a whole lot of explanation of the different kinds of food.  Also, there's an extra charge for to-go containers.  Not a huge deal, as the containers are pretty heavy-duty, but it's not something you see everyday.  Overall, it was a good meal with good friends.  If I make it back to Cleve, it's on the list!"
im certainly not going to sit and tell you whats going on in my personal life but i feel that if you were ever curious about whats going in my life all youd have to do is watch the show
i was very unsure as to how i would feel as i loved the old o
Fish sandwiches and soups are great but still haven't figured out why people like the Reubens so much. A lot of bread and not enough meat. Terrible

"I give this place 2&1/2 stars max. This is my second time here. The first time I came the chicken wings were so salty and dry I thought I ate pure salt. Pho soup wasn't hot. As soon as I put the beef and bean sprouts in, my soup turn cold. This time my caramelize catfish ( ca kho to) has more soup than my Lau canh chua..both are super salty....i normally eat salty, but this is beyond! All my food came before my water. Soup looks good w banana blossom, but it really salty and sour. The waitress give me boxes for to go, I guess I have to touch the hot pot myself. As soon as I was done boxing the food she came to see if I need her help to box. Really??!"

"This review does not apply to sushi. The Chinese food here are typical American Chinese, which is ok. I do enjoy the friendliness and clean dining area. Nothing special, but good place to go for lunch. I might try sushi next time."

"Came back for the third time but this time i tried the hin crust New York style pizza, Michigan Ave. It was what I was hoping for. I've complimented the cooking style of each pizza I've had because that's the best part. This pizza wasn't all fancy with crazy cheeses and ingredients only my foodie gf knows, it was a pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. I pretty much ate about 65% of it. No more weird pizzas for me."

i will admit with the way my life has gone the last few months i havent been feeling very thankful much of the time
i want to share my feelings but don t want to feel humiliated
"This place was by far the prettiest place I'd seen while visiting vegas. It looks like a damn paradise. The weather was perfect and the nightclub has its own pool. But they do not offer any sprt of seating unless u pay for it. Not at all, literally. So being from Oregon, we rhough that was a bit stupid. But the place is very very beautiful!."
Casual sushi / asian restaurant. Relatively inexpensive sushi and bento boxes. I go here for meals on the fly. This is not a high end restaurant. Service is pretty good and the food is pretty tasty.
i think of how much time we spent just doing fun childhood stuff together as a family i feel amazed
i am thankful for the word of god which is a continual source of strength and life that springs up within me when im feeling anxious worried or in need
i couldnt help but feel nostalgic for my grandpa louis and his woodshop in the basement while i was growing up
"I love the fact that they do the inside, but the exterior wash is mediocre.  Reason being is the dirty water that drains out of your side view mirrors makes the car filthy all over again.  They need an air hose or something to blow that water out before it drips all over the side of your clean car!!!  I end up having to wash the vehicle by hand anyway."
i left the seminar feeling a little overwhelmed but now a couple of days down the line i m feeling the i can now begin to add some structure to my research rather than simply flailing around reading anything that may be vaguely relevant
"This place would have received a 4 star rating from me, but I have noticed a change in the way they service walk-in customers. I doesn't seem to matter if there are 5 people waiting in line, they will wait on drive-thru customers first. This was not the case a year ago.. not sure what changed??? As far as food, it's Burger King!... I personally have not received anything bad, given the menu choices.. remember, it's Burger King. The service priority is my only grumble. However, I will say the staff is very friendly. But go to the drive-thru if you want quick service!"
i don t feel so exhausted all the time
"I remember when I was younger and saw the Luxor for the first time. I wanted to stay there! When visiting Vegas recently, I decided to fork out the cash to satisfy my inner child. I don't regret staying in the Luxor - it was clean and quiet - but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's just a middle class hotel, really, and if that's what you want and the Luxor is offering a good rate, then go for it. Just make sure to learn about the resort fee before you make your reservation.  As for my experience, the Luxor was clean but the shower drain was clogged, causing an overflow onto the bathroom floor. Our room had a view of the strip, although being on the south end of the strip, the view wasn't impressive at all. The sloped window was impressive for all of two seconds. Check-in was a breeze. Finally, I'll mention that the salespeople working the hotel floor were a little annoying."
"My 10 year old self is upset with me for giving the Science Center a 3 star review, but my 21+ self was disappointed with the last evening event here.  To knock it out of the way, the 21+ nights are overpriced and the only benefit is the lack of children.  As a student, these nights are not discounted in any way, and you are coughing up $10 early-bird and $15 at the door.  Cocktails inside are $8-$10, and you are paying for food as well.  The 21+ nights have nothing new or especially engaging.  Plus, everyone does 21+ nights now, and the other museums are doing it for less.  CMOA charges $5-$10, and Phipps is doing it for free.  At least the Children Museum's nights let you make cool things to take home for $15.  Now that we've gotten that out of the way, there are some cool things for adults.  The miniature railroad and village area is awesome at all ages (Make sure to blow the train's whistle by pressing the big button about midway through the village.).  Building with the giant blocks has been popular in the past, and the Earthquake Cafe is always a favorite as well.  Make sure to ride the elevator too, as you get to see how that works from the inside.  The one thing I haven't found in recent trips is the weather station exhibit where you can be a weather person.  Is that gone?  The other floors gear to elementary aged-kids.  The water area/playground thingy on the top floor is usually a big hit, although anticipate wet children on the drive home.  If you are coming with kids, be aware that exhibits only half work semi-frequently.  The other thing is that the museum isn't as educational as one might think.  While some exhibits are hands on, things like the physics behind the robot playing basketball are never explained.  I might be hung up on this since my undergrad degree is in math, but I think the museum is lacking in scientific explanation sometimes.  This museum is a great way to spend an afternoon with a student in elementary school."
i get so jealous i feel violent
"This place was ok, very small for a restaurant.  I do not recommend the raw tuna roll as the fish is from Indonesia.   The tako nigiri was not fresh and we're smelly.  They do not love children, as they charge for sharing.  My baby is only a year old, and don't eat much.  I will never go back to this place or recommend this restaurant.  I highly recommend MAKINO's.  All you can eat sushi buffet."
i care so about self worth about recognition about feeling treasured
This night club is one of the best in Vegas. You have more room to dance then most but it has gone down hill since it opened. If you don't have a table they don't have the best customer service towards you.
i feel like yesterday s post was super long and a mash up of everything i ve been holding in the last few days
i have a vague feeling that very little can be will be loved by my year old grandmother my year old niece and everyone in between
i feel that my strength is that i was passionate about everything that i wrote about however this is also my weakness because i would jump around a lot in my papers going from topic to topic and it would not all make sense
i don t know about the readers but i feel extremely uncomfortable at star hotels
"I had the creepiest dining experience I have had in a long time here the other night. I had been once before (I can't believe I didn't review...) for the lunch buffet about a year or two ago and it was really good... there was a wide variety of food and all was tasty....anyway, flash forward to last week, I went for dinner with a friend. We were one of two parties there and it was eerily quiet. Our waitress was a bit odd, but nice enough... the food was expensive and they were trying to push drinks and appetizers and whatnot....I felt like they were a bit disappointed when we just shared one entree and some naan. We got the chicken tikka masala, and it was good, but not as good as I had remembered it from the buffet. About half way through the meal, we were the only people in the restaurant (at like 6:45), and it felt like the employees were all staring at us...they had nothing else to do, it was just an odd feeling. I would consider going back for the lunch buffet, but don't think I would eat there for dinner again."
"Dropped in on my once every five year visit and not much has changed. Still an above ground hole in the Annex and still very busy. Not a place I would go or like to admit I go, and not on any list of any kind I would have. So why 3 stars.... because this place is what it is and it does it well. A great hang out, meeting place and cheap.  Think about it, where would all these people go if this place closed."
This is probably the best value for a burger in a hotel in Vegas. The beef burger starts at $10 and some toppings are extra. I particularly enjoyed the hotwings sauce as a burger topping - amazing! There are usually seats here during the lunch hours. I highly recommend trying the fries (thin cut and crispy) and the deep fried pickles. Great spot to go with coworkers if you're at the LVH for a convention.
Pizza is good.  Place was DIRTY.  Behind counter and in dinning room.  Staff also wasted alot to the toppings.  Crazy
i woke up feeling amazed and then i realized that a dream is still a dream

"I am going to be generous and give this a 3 star because the location is amazing and I wanted so badly to like my meal here.  We used the NoWait app and put our name in 45 minutes before we wanted to be seated and still had to wait for over a half hour after this.  After over an hour wait we were finally seated-I get that it was a busy Sunday afternoon on a beautiful day but really! Next it took our party of 6 over 45 minutes to get our meal. It was nice to enjoy the view of the lake outside on the deck but we were melting by the time our meal came.  I was hoping for Sunday brunch but I guess they stop the breakfast menu at 11-geeze they really cater to those early morning bikers.  I went with the BLT which also came with avocado and a fried egg. It was very tasty and I do like that you were able to pick your choice of a side, I went with the fruit which was just ok.  The prices were high but I guess you are paying for the view.  I want to give this place another chance and go back for happy hour as they have great specials!"
i wonder sometimes whether i have just added to the antagonism and misunderstanding that many people have towards those of us who feel reluctant to wholeheartedly support the traditional armistice day remembrances

i feel a little uncertain about it
i did start to feel some benefit it was extremely boring
"Clean appetizing and varied menu. Tried their coffee last time and found it mild ""donut"" style coffee. I'm a bold coffee drinker and this time I asked for cup of their bold. NO BOLD! Really? OK it is what it is but I gave them 2 tries and I'm moving on. I walk by there on my morning walk and have 2 Starbucks another ""lite"" coffee place, a bagel deli place and 5 full breakfast restaurants on my walk as well. Their loss not mine."

"3 stars for friendly service and decent food.   My husband and I went to have dinner there the other night. We figured that this place had to be on point. The line is always wrapped around the building whenever we would go to Albertson's for groceries. So we gave it a shot. Being pregnant, I have had my infamous food aversions, so I no longer have a love for chicken. So I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into a nice, juicy, char grilled burger!   Once we got home, we tasted our food. The French fries were stale and kind of chewy. Probably not their fault. French fries tend to get a little cold and stale once you get home from the establishment. I ordered the Garlic Portobello mushroom burger and my husband ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Well, they were pretty good. But honestly, I can live without ever having to eat there again. The burgers tasted like something you can get from Applebee's or TGIFriday's. Not bad, but nothing original or to run through the neighborhood screaming about. We will just stick to Smash Burger, Bachi Burger and In n Out for now on."
i feel shaky in my own quit
i get upset or am feeling overwhelmed sad lost or detached i sit on my closet floor with the door closed and the light off
i want to know how people are feeling and if there is anything they are as confused as shit about before i move on
"Salads are pretty good but they only put a measured teaspoon of each item in the bowl. Very tight on the portions! The most annoying thing about this place is the disingenuous staff. Saying ""Perfect"" every five seconds and trying to up sale extra food. Please tone down the fake nonsense! It's just a sandwich shop, not  Nordstroms!"
i feel happy for my partner when they hook up
"If you have a big appetite, Big Heng does not disappoint. The portions indeed are huge. The Yelp reviews here were accurate. I have never been an Egg Drop Soup fan, but because of my daughter's love for this American Chinese creation and the reviews on the soup here, I decided to try the place out. Once again, it did not disappoint. I like this soup so much that I will come back here to carry out this comfort food for sick family members. It was simply delicious. Don't forget to add pepper.  Tonight, we ordered the #1 Dinner Combo with Sweet and Sour Pork, Mooshu Pork Crepes, and Hunan Chicken. They portions are huge. The egg roll was standard American Chinese fare. The Crab Puff was tasty, little crab, lots of cream cheese. The lo mein had a lovely texture, but lacked distinction. The fried rice was okay. The Sweet and Sour Pork had too much batter and the sauce was a dousing of the store bought sauce that they serve with the egg roll. Because of the photographs, I thought the Mooshu Pork would taste more like Peking Duck. The crepe was authentic and so was the sauce that it came with. The filling however was a salty stir-fry of scallions, bean sprouts, fried egg and strips of non-descript pork. Finally, the Hunan Chicken had great ingredients but the gravy was overwhelmingly soya sauce and corn starch. They honored my request for no MSG or Monosodium Glutamate  The servers were fantastic, mostly Cantonese speakers. I felt like I was back in Hong Kong. They were friendly and helpful. When I requested to go boxes, they insisted on packing it up for me. They give me tips on where to get good dim sum. I really wanted to rate Big Heng higher. The service and soup was 5 stars. The rest of the main dishes were on a 2-3 star level. Hence, the 3 star rating. I will definitely return for the Egg Drop Soup."

"This experience was deficient in many ways, but was salvaged by some outstanding employees, including a server whose intentions were good.  Welcome to wonderful Eddie Merlot's.  I wish you much success and fulfillment as you undertake the challenges of managing this fine restaurant.  Our reservation was for 6:00.  We arrived early and were seated at 5:40.  Weston, with whom I have conversed on prior occasions, is the consummate host.  He greeted us warmly, congratulated us on our anniversary, mentioned and honored my OpenTable preference for a booth in the most quiet area of the restaurant.  We were not disappointed with our seating.  The young lady who seated us was pleasant and gracious as well.  A young lady whom we thought might be our server promptly came to determine what type of water we would like and it was delivered. We were then ""dropped"" for more than fifteen minutes as we sat there, waiting for someone to take at least our cocktail orders.  Eventually, our server recognized our status and asked if someone had taken our order.  He stepped in to do so.  Cindy, whose charm and people skills are superior, had become aware of what happened and came over to apologize for our lengthy wait for service.  At this point we were more than ready to order. I believe that instead of assuming that every guest, including returning guests, want a lengthy presentation about the restaurant, that the server should ask whether we have dined there before and then see whether it is necessary to repeat what has been stated during prior dining experiences.  We would have politely declined if asked.  My wife's berry white martini was beautiful and delicious.  My summer ruby spritz was served on the rocks, which I did not realize from the description and did not request.  It was small and mostly ice, but also delicious.  Ground pepper was not offered with our salads, but Cindy promptly responded to my request for it.  I asked our server for the salads to be brought before the filet mignon pot sticker appetizer.  The salads came first as I requested, but he then forgot the appetizer as our entrees were delivered next.  I asked about the appetizer and he said it would be brought right out.  It arrived about ten minutes later.  The appetizer was tiny for the price, but tasty.  I was surprised that we were charged for it, given that it arrived well after the entree.  My pork chops entree was dry and not seasoned; the sauce that accompanied it helped.  My wife's chicken florentine was outstanding: tender, deliciously seasoned meat.  The server brought us dessert menus and suggested that Lizzie would be in the best position to give us the details, which she did.  She was engaging and pleasant.   It took a long time to receive the dessert after ordering it and then to receive the check.  When the check arrived, I found that my $35 Chef's Faves pork chop dinner, which I clearly specified I was ordering, was not on the bill.  Instead, there were a la carte charges of $32.95 for the same pork chops as offered in the Faves dish and $7.95 for the salad.  I brought this to the server's attention and he changed it appropriately.  After we had paid the check and ordered and consumed chocolate cake, it was recognized by the restaurant that this we were marking our anniversary as I specified in my reservation.  At that point, complimentary champagne and creme brulee were graciously brought to the table.  We could not do justice to the creme brulee as we had just finished the large order of chocolate cake.  Our server is charming, gracious, engaging, and suave, which went a long way toward erasing the facets of the meal that were not what we should have received.  Every staff member we dealt with was superior."

"I ended up stumbling on this place the other day during lunch. We went to go to the Thai place that was there, but apparently they moved across the street. At the time I didn't know that. We did see this place, and decided to go into avoid wandering around looking for a place for lunch.   The only complaint I have, is that when we walked in it was very dark, and no customers were in there, and the gentleman working was not very inviting. To clarify: He wasn't mean or anything, we just couldn't even tell if the place was open or not, and being actively warm, friendly, and inviting would be recommended, as it was confusing to determine whether this empty restaurant was under construction or what was going on in there. I am not a very friendly guy, so I don't like doing the duty of breaking the ice, however I had to do it in this case.  After we figured out the place was open for business, we sat down to eat. We looked at the menu, and the it seemed like you got a lot for the lunch specials for the price. I ordered the butter chicken hot, and my coworker ordered the lamb vindaloo. The gentleman working there made it seem like going hot would be a dangerous choice, but I said OK I'll live with it.  The lunch specials were $10, and after we picked and ordered, it didn't seem like it took that long to come out. Well maybe now that I'm thinking about it, it did considering there was no one in the restaurant other than us. So the food came out and I was very happy with the portions and the assortment that was on the plate.  There was what I believe to be a samosa, one of those little cheese dessert balls soaked in syrup, a generous portion of butter chicken, jasmine rice, I believe there was a Tamrind sauce, and a mint chutney I think.  The butter chicken was delicious, however, if you're with company that wants a really hot spicy food, the hot they gave me was not that hot at all. That being said I'm glad because it tasted good, but I could see somebody being disappointed that really enjoys hot food.  another great thing about this place is they gave us a very generous helping of garlic naan. I loved it and unlike another review, there was no sand or whatever in mine. It was top notch Naan.  There was not too much service to be had, but there was not too much service that was needed. The food was good, the pricing seemed reasonable, and I was happy. I would recommend this place.  The ambience (empty, dim, old furniture and decoration style) leaves a little bit to be desired, but maybe they'll become busier and it will seem nicer with people there. The only way I would take a chick on a dinner date here is if I wanted to find out if she was high maintenance or not. If your chick is chill, or you just want to do casual lunch or are you going to do take out this is definitely a great place to go."

"I went back and forth between a 2 and 3. I ordered a mocha and my grieve ordered a latte,  both were cold.  Florentine Benedict was good,  I ordered the Evviva breakfast sandwich which was underwhelming, side of potatoes tasted like something from the frozen food aisle ,  nothing to be excited about. Service was good and our waiter was accommodating, just wished the food and drinks were better."

"Really good food, great flavors. Prices reflect the quality of food not quality of service. The staff was noticeably clique-y, they were more interested in gossiping than service, but really the brunch we had was amazing, omelettes and hashbrowns rocked!"

"2 stars because the service is too casual for a upscale restaurant and the food is not outstanding for the price.   i mean to say the servers are not very dignified or well trained. in spite of there poor service i tipped them very well because i am a dignified customer. Restaurant is clean. The girls at the front are very helpful. Nothing much to write about the ambience as nothing is quite exceptional other than beautiful chandeliers all over the places. Server started to called me buddy, as if we are neighbors. that behavior belongs to smaller restaurants. I accept i did not order my prime rib right, but the correction made by the server is not professional enough. It's like pointing me out as if i dont know nothing about eating steak. Food is dropped on our table as if the other side of the restaurant is caught on fire. There is no gentle placement of the food on the table. Again they behave very casually. They should remember we pay for the ambience and service ethics too. We are party of three people and the table we sat at is quite big. Servers lack minimum common sense to bring in individual sauce cups instead they just left large sauce containers in the middle and we struggled to stretch across the table to dip meat. I have eaten at so many upscale restaurants so can easily differentiate .  we ordered 3 entrees , i ate Prime Rib and i will review about what i ate.  30% of the prime rib is filled with Fat. i like it but just saying. Beginning 10 bites are superb and then after chewy part starts. seriously prime rib suddenly turns into a chewing gum.  Not sure why the same experience did not last until the end. meat dipping sauces (4 different kinds) are so good, i recommend trying them all and stick with what you like the most. I personally liked Peppercorn , Wine based, garlic based sauce.  Huge Prime Rib portion, i ate 70% and packed 30% for my puppies. Overall food experience is better than service.    If you have money, Go ahead give it a try.  If you experienced fine dining earlier then think before you pick this place. You may not experience similar hospitality . Try it if you never experienced fine dining earlier , it will help you for comparision purpose.  Thanks for reading my review."

"Aligned with what other yelpers have said the service was below par... The waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. Our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends. Mistakes happen, but what really pist me off was she didn't say sorry right away. Her face had no remorse about the situation and she went to get towels to clean up. Bah. Then later she forgot to get our tables napkins and when she gave us waters she clanked the glass on the table real loud with attitude. Talk about a Debbie Downer. I do not know what this chick's problem was but if I'm going to pay $20 for a burger I expect more. I will say that the manager handled the situation well after my friend spoke to him. He took off his burger and milkshake off our tab.   Wowee! The black pepper was so bomb and the meat was perfectly cooked. I love how the pepper gave the burger a kick to it. I also love that the bun was toasted and not soggy. The bun was also really fluffy in consistency. The shoestring fries were perfect. I stole some sips of milkshakes from my friends and the ""Birthday cake"" was amazing. I would recommend sharing these milkshakes with a friend or you may get diabetes on the spot.   I give this place a 4, but -1 * for the waitress with the bad 'tude."

Went here on a Thursday - definitely the latest mega club in Vegas!  Find me in the  Hip Hop/Top 40 room -  Very rare to find this music in Vegas as many clubs are EDM which I hate (no offense)  This place has potential - next time gotta check it out on a weekend (Fri or Sat)  Cost us $30/guy on Thurs but I heard it's over $100 on the weekend!!    I would come back here!
"Went there last night with my companion.   We had the calamari appetizer with the aioli dip and tomato-based dip.   It was good but nothing spectacular to make it stand out.  I had the shrimp mediterranean and my companion the pasta brio.   The shrimp had a bit of a spicy kick to it just enough to give it the right flavoring.   It sat on a bed of orzo with an assortment of veggies.   I noticed it had an asterisk next to it, meaning the complete dish is under 700 calories.   That was good since we had just ingested the bread and calamari, and, quite frankly, I was full from that.   I tasted my companion's pasta.   It had chicken and was seasoned with a tomato-based sauce.    I don't normally like tomato-based sauces, but it was a light sauce, meaning it appeared to be mixed with something, and wasn't too much of a tomato taste.  The chicken had kind of a weird texture, almost seemed rolled type, but it didn't taste bad.   Just a weird consistency I couldn't put my finger on.  Our server was Ashley, and she was friendly and efficient.    I have  been here quite a few times for happy hours in the past.   It is a good spot for HH.    I would give it four stars for that.  I'm not sure I would return for dinner.   Don't know.    I would return for happy hour, though."

"First visit to Mickie's Dairy Bar - found parking nearby. Note: CASH ONLY establishment (ATM on site). Greeted right away and sat immediately. This was just after 9:00 am and today is a move in day for students, I know from driving past Mickie's for the past 15 years, you can almost always expect a 20-30 minute wait. Server greeted us with ice water right away and then brought me a hot cup of coffee, which was tasty and fresh. After a couple minutes to decide, we both ordered the most popular scrambler and the server also suggested a piece of their famous coffee cake which today was apple cinnamon or blueberry - we chose apple cinnamon. The coffee cake came out warm and delicious in just a few minutes, so we enjoyed that while they cooked our scramblers. The scramblers arrived and the plate was full. This is a dish made for a Badger Offensive Lineman - as the server said while refilling the coffee... ""slow and steady..."" - definitely needed a couple to-go boxes. Overall great meal and experience, I'll be back."

"This place was recommended to me months ago, but I never had the chance to check it out until now. The deli side has a large menu hanging above the counter advertising sandwiches and such. Boar's Head is proudly displayed throughout which gave me some high hopes. The counter underneath was empty for the most part except for a rack of ribs that were available for purchase.  A gentleman came up to the front from the kitchen area and motioned for me to join him at the end of the counter. There on the counter was the full menu with additional items (Burgers) and a sheet with ""temporary hours."" Those new hours are from 11am-7pm. I went with a pastrami sandwich to go and while waiting for the sandwich, I checked out the butcher section of the shop.  Sandwich is very delicious! There was some difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating, but I am okay with a messy sandwich. Coleslaw was a little on the bland side, but didn't take away from the sandwich much. The wedges were good, nice and crispy from being freshly prepared."

Will I return: only if I'm in the area, no special trip made."

"I was fortunate enough where my friends lined up on our behalf and got us some cakes so that took away the frustrations of waiting in line to get a piece of cake!   In terms of packaging, the cake as seen in numerous (or many to be accurate) Facebook posts everywhere on the internet, they are nicely packaged and the uncle tetsu stamp on top is very adorable.   In terms of flavour, I dont think it's worth the wait. It taste like those $1 sponge cakes that you can get from the Chinese supermarket (a bit more fluffier) with some cream cheese flavour infused into it. It's very light, not too rich, as expected from Japanese desserts. I would buy it again and again if it's on the way and without lineup. But if i had to line up for 30min plus for it, I think you and I could do without it.   Also, their mini cupcakes, do not get them, they are very dry and not good or special at all."

Even if if you ask, the kitchen insists on adding your items AFTER the cheese, so they fall off when you pick up a slice.  Makes me think pizza isn't made to order.  Kitchen is much better mid-week.

"Great beer selection with OK food.  This is one of the premier beer establishments in Pittsburgh.  It is usually extremely crowded on the weekends though.

Also, it's non-smoking!  Yay!  Definitely, will keep coming back here."

"In general, I'd say this location, in comparison to its competitors and other Ross stores, has room for improvement. It's not often that I walk out of here with much, if anything, after browsing.   The lines here - atrocious. People tend to bring about 900 kids a piece to this location, with the double strollers, and the toys and the... you get the idea. It makes for one long wait for a register.   The staff is usually pretty pleasant but the customers are a different story. The place tends to be picked over so I like shopping closer to the SW side of town because of a better selection."
"The Library is quintessential Carson Street - a crowded, noisy restaurant full of local twentysomethings and a menu full of bar food. What makes it unique is its pseudo-intellectual theme. The walls and windows are lined with dusty hardcover classics, and the menus are printed in vintage picture books. Menu items are named for literature greats, with titles like Edgar Allan Potatoes and The Fairest Fowl.  This effort at individualism makes me prefer The Library to other run-of-the-mill South Side bars. It's nice not to constantly experience the same sports-oriented, testosterone-driven atmosphere. The food isn't great but it's not bad either, and definitely hits the spot after a night of drinking. Another perk of The Library is that the kitchen is open until 1am, significantly later than most area establishments.   My top criteria for a great dining experience is that al fresco seating be available in the warmer months. Not only does The Library provide ample sidewalk seating, but it has a sweet roof deck! If you're in the area and are in the mood for some ""Ginger and Fried Pickles"" I'd recommend checking it out."

"This isn't a place that I would typically eat at, but I was with a friend who keeps kosher, so we gave it a shot.  The place is somewhat small, but not crowded and is clean and well maintained.  The service wasn't the greatest but there was only one server and a few tables came at the same time, so I was understanding.  The menu has a decent selection of kosher fare, from burgers, chicken, steak, etc.  I ordered the Kabob which was not what I expected.  It was basically a hamburger on a stick, but the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  The french fries were excellent!  The person I was with ordered the steak and it was tender and tasted pretty good, not sure if it was worth $27 though.  You could probably get the same quality steak at Denny's, but it wouldn't be kosher of course.  All in all, I would come back here if I was with someone who keeps kosher, but won't be back on my own."
i certainly understand why people with connections to the army if they have a relative who serves for instance might feel threatened
"I used to be in the restaurant/bar business, and in many different capacities; from bartender to bouncer, from waiter to cook.  Because of these experiences I tend to be more patient with restaurant workers than most people, but the service I endured at Sweet Mellisa the other morning really pissed me off.  For starters my wife and I joined a group of five for brunch, and it took about ten minutes before the waitress came over to take our drink order, and then another 5 minutes for her to get it to us.  Now the dining room was busy, but I have always lived by the rule of getting the guest their drinks before anything else, it puts them at ease; and they had four or five people waiting tables, so the amount of customers to wait staff ratio wasn't awful.  At one point during the meal someone knocked over some coffee creamer right in front of the waitress, she completely ignored it, no biggie, I'm an adult I can clean it up, but... Then a little later I knocked over a cup of coffee (this really speaks to how cluttered the tables are) and a busboy and waitress were standing there and just staired, I got up and grabbed my own napkins from the bar.  Once again, I can clean it up, but a well trained wait staff grabs napkins and attempts to clean it up.  It was odd because it wasn't like our waitress really appeared to be busy, when she would go missing for 8-10 minutes it wasn't like we saw her running around the floor helping customers, she was no where to be found!  I had two eggs, potato's and bacon.  Lots of bacon, two eggs, and two little potato's?  Really, two potatoes?    Now you may be wondering why I gave three start if my experience was awful, well the food tasted great!  It wasn't real hot, because I assume that the kitchen staff isn't real proficient (only assuming based on how poor the wait staff was trained),  but tasted good none the less.  I was shocked that it tasted as good as it did, granted I had the most basic breakfast of all.  I tried someones french toast and it was to die for, I wish I would have ordered it!  Good food, terrible service, and a lot over priced based on portions.  For a place owned by a former waitress of Max's I can't believe how bad the wait staff was.   Will I go back?  I'm sure I will be in Ohio again and will want to give it another shot.  I assume the rest of their menu tastes just as good.  Sorry for beating the wait staff dead horse."

"Most Asian owned donut chains.over my years have been pretty average and this place continues the trend. They always make a ton of donuts, but few stand out, most will ""do the trick"" but nothing over the moon to show. The coupon in New Times is BOGO.

"This place is classic east coast Italian, with parking in the rear and an unmarked back door entrance included.  Definitely a run down, hole in the wall type of place with a musty smell and a decor I'm sure hasn't ever changed in the decades this place has existed.    Five of us came in on Saturday night on a whim to ""try something different"" from our usual haunts.  Boy was this place different!  We sat in the bar area where several tvs were showing the cards preseason game, and one muted tv was on the sound of music...  There were 3 or 4 other parties in the bar area, average age was approx 68.  Fortunately none of them really had any problem with our obnoxious drunkenness.  Not sure how many people were in the dining room portion of the restaurant, but suffice it to say the place was far from empty, which is always a good sign.  But there was only 1 bartender/waitress working in the bar area, and though we were more than patient and amiable, she was still very flustered with her duties.  Eh, we were drunk and didn't care.  On to the food.  We ordered the eggplant rollatini and mozz sticks to start, a pizza, manicotti, chicken parm, and fettuccine alfredo.  Everything was pretty good, huge portioned, relatively cheap, traditional italian(-american) food.  It really hit the spot!  The marinara sauce was incredible, and the manicotti was bursting with ricotta.  The pizza was good, the chicken parm standard (the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente), and the fettuccine was probably the loser of the group (my meal, of course) - it was good, but not as creamy as I had hoped.  All in all, this was exactly the type of experience we expected and went looking for.  I honestly have a feeling we'll all be back."

"When we knew were going to be in town for a while I did some Yelp-Search to find a place to eat for lunch. Being particularly fond of the hamburger, we found a couple of locations that really looked good. In the interest of full disclosure the first place we went to was closed for renovations. I had actually planned on getting a burger at both places so we were going to go to Dotty's anyhow. Dotty's was busy when we arrived and we have about a 20mn wait. Not bad at all and usually a good sign when a place is busy. We had already done our homework and knew what we wanted to order. I ordered the Pub burger with fries, my wife wanted to save herself for a special dinner and only went with the fried pickles.  Our order arrived pretty quickly. I hit my burger right away. While my burger was cooked perfectly, the cheese was not melted. Munster cheese is usually a pretty good cheese to use for melting and this was not melted. My burger was supposed to have bacon and I don't recall seeing any bacon. Maybe it was cut up, just didn't stand out. While my burger was good, I felt it was missing some of the fat and goodness that I crave with a burger. The fries were good and I took every opportunity to dip them in what tasted like homemade ranch dipping sauce that came with my wife's fried pickles. The fried pickles by the way were very good. The pickles tasted homemade. They were crispy and the ranch dipping sauce was a perfect compliment. Dotty's has a lot of burgers and I would totally be up for trying some of their other burgers. Dotty's is an old school place and had I gone to school in Madison, I'd be there a few nights a week and on the weekends for a burger and a beer."
im so scared something happened to him and im praying like crazy that this isnt actual gut feeling im having but a paranoid feeling im getting due to me always assuming the worst

"Bad service which completely destroyed the whole experience for myself and the rest of my family,  but the food was great however and if they could fix their service problem this restaurant would be a must go to"
"If you blink you will miss it. So in that essence it fits the ""hole in the wall"" category. The parking however doesn't seem to be a problem since there is a lot if street parking all around the empty neighborhood. Inside the restaurant is a whole different story... It is alive with all the sounds of hustle and bustle coming from the open kitchen area and the echoing sounds of the warehouse style seating area coming from all the seated patrons. In short it's loud in here, definitely lively but wouldn't suggest this place if you are planning on having a conversation. The service is amazing so much so I thought at one point I had three servers since more than one person came to check on us. Now to the food. I ordered the downtown egg Benedict and there famous pancake and my husband had the two egg special. The plating of both were beautiful and the portions were generous but the flavors were not very memorable. Overall from a score of 1-10 I give  this place a 5"
Food is decent.  Little pricey for what you get.  Burger was cooked right and juicy.

"For being a sushi restaurant in the Bellagio I am fairly disappointed at this place. The price for the food is too high compared to what actually came out. The flavors of some of the dishes just did not match my palette. I am a huge sushi fan, but I didn't even want to try their nigiris. The sushi rice was way too sweet, and the fish they served was okay. I would not really want to go back to eat here again, especially at the price that they put everything at."

"The Penguin by name is a Charlotte classic. Unfortunately we didn't go earlier before the original place closed down, and only had the opportunity to go under the current ownership. While I can't compare it to how it used to be I can say that it is currently a decent burger joint. Not the best in the area, but still offers a solid burger experience.  The place looks like a real dive on the inside and out, but it's more about the food than the ambiance (at least in my book.) The menu is a bit confusing since the one on the website is not the one same as what they give you in the restaurant, so if you saw something you liked online you will have to figure out it's new name listed on the restaurant's menu. Not a huge deal, but the least they could do is keep the website updated. I was surprised to see that they offered Stewart's Root Beer...something I haven't had since leaving New York almost two years ago. We each got a bottle of that delicious soda ($1.95) and enjoyed sipping on it while awaiting the arrival of our burgers.  I ordered the Adelie burger ($7.95) and it was scrumptious. It's your basic ""Carolina"" or ""Southern"" burger in that it's topped with chili and cole slaw. The burger was a decent size and was delicious. The chili was a good chili and the slaw was crisp and tangy, bringing a variety of flavors to the overall burger. I had the sweet potato fries as a side and they were pretty dang good.  My wife ordered the King Penguin ($7.95), simply because she is a sucker for pimento cheese and fried pickles. She really enjoyed both on her burger. She tried to be a bit healthier and ordered the cole slaw as a side rather than some fries, but that didn't stop her from stealing a healthy portion of mine.  From a standalone point of view (not comparing it to the ""glory days"") the Penguin is a decent place to grab a burger. They are not the best burgers around but still a solid joint. The fact that the menu isn't up to date with what they actually offer and the cold, drafty interior definitely take some points away. I'd go back if I was in the area, but living in Huntersville it's a bit of a hike for us. And with Bad Daddy's serving up better burgers less than five minutes away I doubt we'll return."

"I cannot complain about the sister restaurant of the Harris Grill.  I mean, who does not love Frozen Mimosas and Frozen Cosmos?  They also have  a pretty good brunch too.  Oh, and who can forget bacon night (although I wish the bar area was bigger as the seats get taken fast!).    They have an extensive drink menu and their menu has something for everyone in my opinion.  Some of it is done much better than others though.  The service here has been consistent for the most part so I cannot complain there.    I love the outdoor deck area when the weather is cooperating with us too.  And A+ for some off street parking (although it fills up fast)."
i feel i want to reach back and pull some of those parts of her back into myself because theyre such useful tools for my onward journey
"Casella's is better than Subway, but nothing particularly special.  The 4.5 star review it has is extremely inflated.  I didn't write a review for a long time, because I feel bad since it's a family business, and I do wish them the best of luck.  However, I don't like when businesses have undeserved high ratings.  It's not worth the trip to the ATM beforehand to pay cash only.  If you happen to be at Basha's next door, and are hungry for a sightly better than Subway sub, and have some cash on hand, it's not a bad experience.  If you aren't already in the area, however, it's not worth the extra effort."

"Wow, this place is unexpectedly fun to eat at.  There were a lot of bachelorette type of groups all loud and having fun. It's a catchy energy going on in here.   I just didn't think Jose Andres would have a dimsum / taco place and get away with it. The food although pricey (what do you expect at the Cosmo, Chinatown take out prices?) was goooood and yummy.    We had When Pigs Fly, Sui mai Scallops, Har Gau, Ocean Nest, Tuna Ceviche, Langosta Tacos and Viva China. Viva China had a little kick to it. I'd order that again next time  I got a ""had this taste before but there's a definite new twist added"" so it was fantastic. I'd come back here again for a quick lunch or dinner before heading to Marquee next door.  It's true though, don't expect to be stuffed. I was hungry around 4 am later.  These are tapa style plates meant for sharing and a fun atmosphere. It's NOT a romantic place so don't expect that here."

Just OK. I got the arugula salad and the gnocchi and the other one of us got the brick flattened chicken. The food was pretty good but all the vegetables they claimed to come with were chopped so fine that they were lost in sauce land. So I had just gnocchi and he had just chicken. The food was still good but after the hour and ten minutes it took a I come out I was hoping it would be well worth the wait. It was probably an extra long hour plus because I couldn't hear the person I was sitting with as this place appears to draw in a loud Case Western crowd. Glad I gave this place a try but probably won't be back. There are just too many Italian places within 15-20 minutes that blows this place out of the water.
The decor and atmosphere are great. We had very good service and the food was good. I feel like the prices are high and they try too hard with the specialty cocktails.

"Not a big fan of breakfast food, BUT everything I ate here was actually VERY good! I had strawberry pancakes, sausage patties and a bowl of grits.  However, I will be hesitant to return because of a few things:  a) The place is small and the wait can be quite long. We went on a random Thursday around 11 am and, despite it not being very crowded, we waited 20 minutes for a table...  b) Service....was pretty bad. After waiting, we were not greeted by our server for another 10 minutes...  c) Cleanliness: Our table when we were seated had not been properly washed. I also witnessed loys of crumbs/mess on the floor beneath other tables. They appeared to be using a bissel to try to keep up with the mess, but it was not pleasant to see as a diner.  d)Long Wait for Food AFTER Ordering   Use this information as you will!"

I've seen a similar act at the Absinthe show and it was no where near as good as this one."

"Basha's proximity to Mcgill is definitely an asset. They offer fairly large portions at decent prices.   I had the chicken plate which had pretty sizable servings of potatoes, rice, chicken, and salad. I had to take some home, and I'm a pretty big guy.   My main complaint was that the chicken was dry - really dry. I'm not sure if it had something to do with having an early lunch and maybe getting some edges of the chicken, but it really held back the meal quality.   I wasn't the most impressed, especially with other really good Lebanese restaurants not too far away. But, if you're in a hurry, hungry, and craving Lebanese food, Basha might have something for you.    Be aware they only take cash or debit."

"Ordered Bang Bang Shrimp dish for lunch.  For $20 I expected more.  5 Shrimp, and 4 chunks of chicken over pasta.  It lacked the bang bang flavor.  Still good, but expected more for the price."

Never had frozen yogurt before so I kinda was expecting the yogurt I always eat. I went for the coffee flavor. I didn't see any toppings that I liked except fruit. 4. I enjoyed the snack. This would be a great way to cool off in the summer. I believe I will have to give these yogurt places more business in the future especially with the kids.
i know how you feel insert sympathetic arm pat
"Review is based on two visits to Pinky. Both times I came with a friend and we did walk-ins without appointments. Most recently I came yesterday (a Monday) and didn't have to wait at all, but the time before that they were busier and we had to wait about half an hour. They have a good selection of regular polishes (which are very well organized) as well as shellac and OPI gel. However, sometimes they are running low on some colours (i.e. last time I was asked to select a different colour because the nail tech didn't think there would be enough to cover all my nails...?) and also the colours on their shellac wheel are kind of faded and not accurate - was surprised when they brought out some of the bottles and the colours were not even close to what I thought I picked! But luckily they were accommodating and let me change my mind a few times.  Both times I came, I got a shellac mani and got a regular pedi as well once. For what I can see, the service is kind of hit or miss. Some of the people there are super friendly, but some of them are definitely more reserved and/or have some attitude. The first time I got a male technician who seemed nice enough, but I think didn't speak much English and was a bit klutzy. The second time I got a girl who seemed very proficient at her job, but gave me some attitude when I asked if she could file my nails shorter after she had finished doing one hand - if she had asked me before she went ahead and did all my nails, I would have put in the request sooner!  That being said, there are definitely a few things I do like especially about Pinky. The services are very thorough, as in, for the pedicure they take the time to scrub and massage your legs, which not all other places do, and which I really really liked. Same with the manicure, I like that they moisturize your arms and hands and massage in the lotion. You also get a back massage, which is pretty cool if you're into that stuff - I do wish they would ask you before they just go ahead and start touching you though.  In terms of the actual mani/pedi, the quality is pretty good, and I didn't have issues with my shellac chipping or anything the first time. It is a bit pricey and unlike some other places they charge tax on top. I don't see this becoming my go-to place, but it's a decent nail salon in downtown Toronto."
"This place...took all of our money...stay away from the Casino. These dealers are ruthless!!! Go to Bellagio or MGM instead!  Just kidding, but I mean they are ruthless and did take all of our money. Inside decor is great, lots of great shops that are too expensive for the 99% of people. 99% of shops in there are also empty of shoppers. This is just a good place to window shop or look at the decor and architecture."

i feel the character im doing is a little more beaten down and the comedy is a little bit smaller
"I think this is a pretty average restaurant. I came in for lunch and was seated promptly. I ordered the turkey club and a cup of clam chowder. The sandwich was good but the clam chowder had no seasoning and no flavor at all. The service was very fast and friendly. Seems like a decent place for lunch, I will just skip the soup next time."
i genuinely feel for the characters and am keen to uncover every part of the story
"So the only reason I am giving 3 stars is we dined in thinking they would have adequate seating. Boy was I wrong. They had a tv on playing a hockey game which was so loud I couldn't pay attention to anything else.   Also, I order a chicken Greek salad and totally had a brain fart and forgot to ask for the dressing on the side. When I was finally able to track the owner down he was not super kind about the request saying that he had already made it and kinda huffing & puffing about how he would have to make a new one. I am way to big of a push over and agreed that it would be fine.   The salad was actually quite delicious and thankfully he didn't totally overdo it with the dressing but it was still a little too oily. The food alone is at least 4 starts and I might be back but only for take out and now I know to ask for the dressing on the side.   The owner did offer after the food came out to make me another one if I didn't like it, but it would have been nice to have been offered that option first.   They also have no restrooms and served my meal on a paper plate. In my opinion, it's a take out only place."

"I should get a little worry or should I be really afraid?  A brand new St Louis Bar Bar & Grill just open up in the plaza right next to Moksha Yoga RH!!  This evening while practising on an empty stomach in a heated room, all I think about was an iced cold beer and hot like hell wings, and would the Leaf going to win tonight's game!  Service here was amazing. Friendly and polite.  The restaurant itself is small and cozy with enough TV so no matter wherr you sitting, you would have a good view.  A Lb of their Hot As Hell Wing and Perfect fries went so good with my Mill St Organic.  PS the manager opened the door and welcomed me in and the bartender really personal... made me feel right at home!  I will be back....anytime"

I personally like the veggie dogs from here. They are probably the same as from the grocery store. They are small. Snack size. Good if I'm starving after work or b4 the gym. Not good for a meal unless you eat several. I ordered one like the picture and of course it barely had a topping. (Toppings are .75 extra) The coconut drink I had was good but tasted like 100% sugar. I wouldn't go out of my way for this. It's not like Pinks. Then again.. Pinks is usually $25 a meal and this place is about $6.
i feel like some kind of violent event happened here gutro says

"It's been a long time since we were here.  I remember this being at least a 4-star place.  But based on this visit, I can't really go over 3-star.  By looks, the ambiance is fine.  ""Looks Japanese"".  But they play contemporary rock.  Doesn't fit.  It was enough that I noticed it, which isn't great.  We couldn't do tepanyaki (my first choice) because they had a ""large party coming"".  Several people showed-up, but there were still several griddle/tables available.  I assume they didn't have enough chefs to staff them, but don't really know.  If the room had been filled it would have been easier to shrug my shoulders and accept they had reserved the space.  But it wasn't, so it was a bit annoying.  So we grabbed a table.  We could have grabbed seats at the sushi bar, but we wanted some hot food too.  We ordered a few sushi rolls, and one stir-fried (I assume) beef and vegetable dish (I think it was called Yakiniki).  The rolls were fine.  Nothing really special.  Better than you get pre-packaged in a grocery, certainly.  But I've had better in other restaurants.  Not as good as I remember last time I was here, but maybe my memory is fooling me.  Given the pricing, it should be better.  Again, they were fine.  But not ""wonderful"".  The beef dish was disappointing.  Not much beef.  LOTS of mushrooms, plus some other veggies.  Sauce was nothing special.  Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.  All in all, an unextraordinary meal.  It was fine.  But not as good as I remember, nor as good as I would expect for a place that charges what Ninja charges.  Glad I had a Groupon.  Helped defray my actual out-of-pocket, so that was nice.  If the service had been better I might be able to give 3.5 stars.  But service was inattentive, and inconsistent.  Sometimes it was cheerful, and other times it was impatient.  From the same server over a matter of 10 minutes.  Very strange.  So three stars it is.  I would not avoid this place, but I won't make a point of eating here again either."

"It's good to finally have a healthy fast food option at the Mills. Green Leaf's is like a mini salad bar, you pick your lettuce either spring mix or romaine, four sides and a dressing for between 7-8 dollars. You can choose additional sides for a dollar a piece. Sides include the usual, cucumber, shrooms, olives, cheese, my favorite jalapenos etc..however they have a slightly seasoned tasty chicken, and big chunks of Bacon not bits but big bites of Bacon! At a quick glance there is a good selection of dressings at least ten, with a chipotle something or other and  Mmm sriracha..of which I didn't notice until after I chose the usual ranch, epic fail! The labels are hard to read in small print wrapped around the top of the bottles, and I didn't see them listed anywhere. My suggestion is they list them on the case, reducing squinting, and people's faces & handprints on the glass. Your salad selections are tossed in a big bowl, mixed with your desired  amount of dressing and put in a not as deep as it looks to go container. A decent deal and a healthier option for lunch, it's about time!"

Very thin and crunchy crust.  Descent toppings. Not NY but good.  There is not anything else other than Cal zones on the menu.  The salads were excellent but with subpar dressings.

"We ventured here during a trip to Montreal because Fairmount bagels are a thing and when we travel, we have to try all of the things. Fairmount bakery is a small bakery. Only a few people can wait inside and the rest outside, regardless of weather obviously. You order at the counter and there's no place to sit inside or even eat inside standing. You have to take them to go and find somewhere to eat them. It's also even difficult to find benches outside in the area to eat the bagels. You can purchase a single serving of Philadelphia cream cheese to go with the bagels if you'd like. They won't slice or toast the bagels for you. This place is mostly a to go bagel shop for people who are buying dozens of bagels. Just be prepared for this before you go. I got the garlic bagel. Honestly, the garlic was a bit burnt and the bagel was hard on the outside with a chewy inside. This is how Montreal bagels are suppose to taste but I just don't think I like Montreal bagels! If you want bagels, come to New York City and you'll see what a delicious bagel tastes like."

"I want to give this between 3-4 stars  Everyone told me that ""we had to go"" - admittedly, I was very excited, I had read the cookbook and seen the wonderful pictures of the food.  But to be honest, I was not blown away.  The oysters were delightful - done escargot style and we had the fried foie gras - which was silly and too rich and the cote de bouef which was fantastic but HUGE. But I guess I was expecting a more french touch - subtler, nuanced flavors.  I was v happy that I went - and nothing was wrong with the food - just not a must have.  Nothing that any decent restaurant in Brooklyn isnt doing."

"Just tried some take-out from here last night for the first time.  Got the chicken pad thai and the jumbo shrimp red curry.  First I just want to say, how lazy are these people that their ""jumbo shrimps"" aren't even de-shelled or de-veined at all?  The last thing you want to have to worry about at the dinner table is taking the digestive tract out of your shrimp and wiping it on the napkin beside you or whatever.  There is no excuse for this but sheer lazyness.  Also, another thai curry ruined by the ridiculous addition of green bell peppers.  This is NOT a thai ingredient and should not be in your curry.  Now with the bad out of the way, the rest of the food was pretty acceptable.  Pad Thai was the opposite of sweet and a little darker than I'm used to, makes me think they're using soy sauce in it, but the flavor works.  Curry was tasty, although not enough liquid and as I said, ruined by the gigantic chunks of bell pepper and un-prepped shrimp.  Next time I would order it with no bell peppers and change the shrimp to another protein.  I will give it another shot soon and report back."

What is all the fuss about Verandah?  I went to this restaurant to the brunch buffet on the reviews of other Yelpers.  I was wondering if I might of missed something because the food was about as good as a regular breakfast buffet at a sub-par venue.  The outside venue is nice but.... Maybe people don't get out much in Vegas because there are way better places to eat a brunch buffet.  The Buffet at Caesars and The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan are way better for around the same price.  There were five people in our party and one had a birthday and the total was $210.00 after tax and before tip.  My son said Mom you should gave me the $200.00 and went to eat at Sunrise Cafe.  Wow now I know how rich folks get taken advantage off.  I'll be eating at the other fore-mentioned buffets before I come back here.  One note I will say is that we could have just ordered of the menu and it would have probably been cheaper.  So I cannot review it as a regular restaurant FYI.
i just feel that this couldve functioned as an opportunity to show that theres more to comics than action scenes and tortured souls in spandex
i feel like the cardinals have fucked me more times than any other team in picks this season
"Basis this review on a single take out visit...but was an OK experience.  The food is rather expensive for what it is.  They have a pretty wide menu with plenty of options, though you can't get small sides of items, which is frustrating...paying $7 for tabbouleh is silly.  The lamb rolled pita was decent - a little light on the meat, but decent...though I don't think I'd pay $8 for it again...  There are better places to go in the area...but isn't a bad place to try."

"This is one is a very good place among the so many places the China Town has to offer. They offer both sushi selections and hot pots. Which is a pot with your choice of broth, meats and vegetables.   The one we chose was the hot pot with the spicy miso broth, just the broth itself was good. We also chose the seafood selection which came with mussels, shrimp, scallops, salmon, and veggies. I had read on Yelp how good the Kobe beef was, so we added an order into the pot, which i'm glad we did. There are two options in size, the healthy portion and i believe the other was called the hungry portion. We tried the healthy portion which was more than enough to share between two people.   When i checked in with Yelp i got a free hot sake, so worth it."

i feel a perverse pride in my self control that i managed to stay where i was ordered and not reach for the tempting human flesh so close before us
i think because she doesnt feel it and also because she knows she will be petted and admired and given a special only her treat for being good
i understand the feeling so i wouldnt be shocked
"I had low expectations for Social House, mostly because it is AMPD & because the reviews weren't that great.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, although we only had sushi.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed very large pours of wine which I am definitely not complaining about! The service was just OK, had to constantly ask for different things and was not approached by the bartendar at all to check on us, our food was spilled by the server twice upon delivery, mistakes happen I get it.  The Poke & Spider roll were delicious.  The place was surprisingly empty for a saturday night at 8 oclock but it is also HUGE inside.  I would return."
i think i respond pretty level headed to comments that come across respectful but i will not censor my snark when i feel someone is being rude
i came to spot out some personal differences we have and that made me feel uncomfortable for some reason
im not feeling vicious just

"To start off if you want to go for a dinner I recommend making reservations, the walk in wait time is super long, you'd wait about 1 1/2 hr. They'll give you a device and when it vibrates you are seated, after waiting about an hour and a half they made us wait another good 30 mins. When we finally sat down we waited a little and they asked for our drinks.Waiting for the food also took FOREVER we waited about an hour and ten mins. And this is not a very everyday dinner this place is more on the pricey side, your looking at about 23 dollars per person. Which might not sound like a lot until you see your bill."
i don t have to live like that anymore but i m also grateful for the memory because that memory is pretty much the first one that my mind flicks to when i m feeling aggravated at mankind as a whole and afraid of everything including my shadow

"If you are coming from NY or CT traveling to Montreal, Lacolle Border Crossing is your best bet mileage wise, having said that, it is always a crap shoot once you arrive at the border as to how long the queue is. The earlier in the day you arrive the better, between 8 to 9:30am seems to be best. For many, an overnight in Plattsburgh works nicely as the border is 15 mins from there and Montreal another 50 minutes.An overnight gives you almost a full day in Montreal. When leaving Canada don't forget to stop at the Duty Free Shop, often there are promotions  on beer, wine, spirits, colognes and perfumes."

"I went here the other night after a night of drinking at Superbowl party.  This is very close to Mill, and it is indeed a good place that is open until 3 am for drunk people.  I got the chicken on skewers, hummus, and the greek fries.  A few of my friends got the bruschetta chicken with a pesto sauce.  Their food looked really flavorful, and mine was okay.  I had to use hummus and tahini to add some extra flavor.  I do have to saw, the Greek fries are superb.  It is a good size portion of fries with garlic sauce and feta cheese.  I can totally see some people coming late night to munch down on these fries."
i feel envious of those other mothers i hope that my children one day take something away from those choices and just remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side
i feel like the person i am loving doesn t deserve it
i should text him or not while feeling so restless i felt like kicking and screaming
"Overall, food is ok/good, but not sure if it's worth the price.  But then again....everything in the Wynn is pretty pricey....so this is actually one of the less pricy restaurants in Wynn with the romantic, dim-candlelight feel.  Appetizer: Ordered the baked clams to share.  Basically breadcrumb-covered buttery clams.  A bit on the savory side, but still a good dish to order.  Main course:  shared the scallops & the meat lasagna.  Between the two, the lasagna was better....it was cooked well (not overly soggy) & the amount of cheese was perfect...not too much.  The scallops were good, but very standard....as in you could get the same flavor/taste from any restaurant."
"A cute place with average food that is one of the few left to allow pets...and that's the reason you come here.  I'm not sure why so many rave about such average food, but it makes for a nice setting and a spring/summertime lunch.  Maybe if I had the cheesecake I'd be in a better mood ;)"

The food was excellent and our waiter was not only attentive but friendly and accommodated my fish allergies (I can eat shellfish just not actual fish). Our glasses were never empty and any trash on the table disappeared just as soon as it was created. Our dinner was served in a timely manner and our drinks well made. Everything was exactly the way I remember it from my youth my disappointment was how far it's fallen in manner of class. McCormick and Shmick used to have a dress code and an expectation of elegance. We dressed to go out and found ourselves surrounded by people speaking loudly on their cellphones and in t-shirts. Not only has the standard for their dress code died but so has their desire to create a comfortable atmosphere I felt like I was in a noisy McDonald's with crying children and cellphone conversations as well as cellphone arguments going on all around me. The food is still wonderful but it's not what it used to be.
"It's a beautiful hotel, and I liked it for the most part BUT...  * This is NOT the place to stay if you're not there to go clubbing. I was here with my husband for a quiet birthday weekend and to catch some shows. Every night we walked to our hotel we were swimming upstream through obnoxious brats on their way to the club. Girls in crazy heels not watching where they're going, rolling 4-5 deep, too drunk and awkward on their heels to move in a graceful manner, and guys just, well there. * Upside, our room was low floor with a cr@p view but relatively quiet. Didn't hear any club noise - and only occasional noise from the room next door *I liked our room overall, nice size, comfortable bed, nice understated decor * Room wasn't QUITE as clean as I would have liked. Couch was dusty...wtf? I ended up putting towels across the seats. * Like many other hotels, we had to pay the resort fee, so we just used our WiFi like the wheels were going to fall off :) * Hubby's a picky eater so he wasn't feeling most of the restaurant options, until we got to the Wynn Buffet. I've never seen his eyes light up over food like that before. The buffet was awesome and a great way to end our trip. * I thought the location was going to be a huge minus being somewhat far up the street, but it was perfect. Great proximity to the bus stations (Fashion Mall(?) stop) so super easy to get the lower part of the Strip as well as Fremont Street.  I would easily have given this place 4 stars but the damned club kids knocked it down a star."

"- Service was good - We ordered:  + Tuna Kinilaw which was tuna sashimi with some kind of sour sauce and shrimp chips, it tastes ok to me but my bf thought it was good   + Chicken Adobo is basically bake chicken with soy sauce that I usually cook at home, nothing special. Definitely not woth $20    + Ginataan is deep-fried cauliflower with little cuts of coconut, it was good   + Garlic rice to eat with the meat, went pretty well   + Flan cake (i don't remember the entire name) it's like a purple ube pudding on top and cheese in the bottom, decorated with couple drops of lemon juice and tiny pieces of grapes. This cake was a signature of our night, I thought the flavour blended super well together and totally different from the flans that I usually have. - Price varied from $10-20 per dish - Will not come back again because the food is like typical asian/chinese food that I can make it at home."
i feel a bit apprehensive maybe because i haven t been back for over year and a half
Not sure why this place gets such race reviews. I have been here 3 times and nothing special. The pizza is no better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. Only difference is I have to take it home and cook it myself.

"My wife ended up getting a ""free"" stay at this resort because she booked a trip to NY last year at a Holiday Inn that was next to the reception venue we were going to be at.  I guess they do this to try and sell their time shares.  So we reluctantly booked it as we go to Vegas often so why not get a free stay?  Unfortunately you have to sit through their sales presentation but we already knew we were going to say no so no biggie.  The resort itself isn't bad.  The first one we had reeked like cigarette smoke so we asked to be moved.  The living room actually has a gas burning fireplace.  Who the hell needs a fireplace in hot-ass Vegas?!?!  The rooms are a decent size and have a full kitchen which is nice since you can buy your own food and cook to save a bit of money.  But we mainly go to Vegas for the food scene so doing our own cooking isn't high on our list.  The bedroom was pretty small.  In fact there's only about 2 feet of space between the edge of the bed and the wall and with the TV mounted on that wall I had to walk sideways to be able to get around the bed.  The bedroom has a nicely organized closet but unfortunately the one we had, had no light in it so it was hard to find your belongings once you had put them in there.  There is a restaurant on the property and a little market downstairs that has most things you could need but the prices are outrageous.  Then again it's Vegas and everything's expensive.  When you do the time share presentation they take you to one of the model rooms which are actually much nicer and a little bigger than the ones you get on a normal stay.  I thought this was a little weird.  If you're trying to get me to buy a time share I would assume you'd want to impress me right off the bat.  We spent about 2 hours total on the presentation even though we told the sales guy right off the bat that we weren't buying.  But they didn't pressure us too much.  They just gave us the normal speil about how you spend so much money every year going on vacations and time shares save you money and you can go to all these different places and blah, blah, blah.  The resort has 5 pools but they're all pretty small and funky shaped so they're not good for trying to do laps or get any exercise in.  The complex has 2 exercise rooms but the one I looked at was a joke.  All it had was one lat pulldown machine, a chest press machine, a leg extension machine and a couple of treadmills.  No way to get a quick full body workout like I was wanting.  The resort is directly behind the Linq about a block away from the strip, but Vegas blocks are HUGE.  The shuttle times aren't super convenient so quite a few times we just walked up to Harrah's and would catch the monorail from there to go up and down the strip.  The shuttles run pretty much every other hour.  Having the shuttle run every hour would be much more convenient.  The main lobby has this weird smell.  I don't know if it's supposed to be some sort of flower but I don't want to smell any flower that smells like that.  Overall this resort is just OK.  It's not terrible but I wouldn't stay there again."
i feel dissatisfied since ive been doing nothing
im sorry or pobresito instead of poor boy because seriously who says poor boy girl when youre feeling sympathetic nowadays

"I had a pretty good time here.  We came here after a preseason game for drinks and sat out on the patio.  The service was great.  Its in a pretty cool part of town that you can sit, relax and enjoy the ""downtown vibe""  From there you can walk to several other places.  We didn't eat but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. Seems like a place where a lot of fans come before the game as the arena is a short walk away. Worth checking out."

"The food here is really good, but I miss the casual old neighborhood place.  I used to stop in for quick sandwiches all the time -- you'd walk up to the counter, order a sandwich to go, and the very efficient guys behind the counter would have you walking out with a great sub in just a few minutes.  For the last year, though, it's table service.  Same good food, but slower and more expensive.  An Italian sub (no side) and a coke is now $14 with a 20% tip. Sure it's good, but that's not something I'm going to do every day."
i feel that we should in some way be supporting the olympics with great gusto well everyone else is
"My gf introduced me to Roberto's, and if she hadn't, there's an excellent chance I would've missed Roberto's altogether.  It's un-remarkably decorated to the point of almost drab inside and out, at least the location I patronize, but clearly Roberto knows he doesn't need to spend money on the ambiance since people flock there to eat.  I don't really know authentic Mexican food, and I tend to go for the ala cart items like a simple regular taco, but I can judge a good place by the line at the counter that's there no matter what time of day (and Roberto's is open 24/7).  Because of hours of business, the place can sometimes draw an odd crowd.  If I were hungover, second only to Waffle House, I'd go for Roberto's at 3AM, but that's another story for another kind of forum.    My gf gets the #11 every time.  I don't know what all is in that, but she never deviates from that item.  She piles on the carrots from the condiment bar, too.  She loves Roberto's and that's really why I continue to spend money at this place because the food in terms of flavor, doesn't really stand out to me, but I can tell a real difference in Roberto's dishes compared to other fast food Mexican joints.  It's fresh, for starters.  And for fresh, they prepare it made-to-order every time and quickly.  If the crowd at Roberto's is unruly, at least I don't have to hang around there too long."

"Met a co-worker for dinner and drinks. My favorite drink here is the Blue Hawaiian. So good! I forgot how noisy this place can be, so we had to talk a little louder. I got the teriyaki chicken and fried rice (no veggies). I liked it, but I thought the chicken was kinda dry. Certainly on the pricey side for what you get."
i won t even go in stores because i feel so unwelcome
"Staff were attentive although we struggled with their iPad wine list, which was having some trouble with sold-out wines reappearing. They also gave a presentation on their steak cuts and recommended doneness levels for each one, only to get 4 out of 8 of our orders wrong-- my beef tenderloin was medium instead of very rare as I had requested.   We had some tasty cocktails, lychee and blueberry iced tea, and the side dishes (lobster mac and cheese, truffle poutine, garlic mashed potatoes) and appetizers (prawns, calamari) were fine. The individual sides were quite large portions and could be shared between a couple of people.  Overall everything was tasty but the experience was drawn out unnecessarily by errors and I'm not sure it was worth the price."
i was feeling a little apprehensive that it was going to be a flop or that i was expecting too much
"Went for breakfast, was told to seat myself, not a problem at all had a nice seat at a well placed table since it was earlier in the morning and hardly anyone was there. I wasn't greeted by my server for 6-8 minutes, where she immediately gave me coffee (decaf), a great start to the morning, however it the coffee was hardly hot, and tasted like it had been mixed with a lot of water. Of course I know decaf is a little different than regular, but this was hardly resembling the taste of coffee. After another 8-12 minutes, my server came over again to see if I wanted to order and I got the Market hash, and asked for water, as she had not offered it to me or brought it over for the last nearly 20 minutes. She got it right over and within the next 10 minutes my food was out. It was absolutely delicious and i loved it! great seasonings, flavor and combination of veggies and eggs, wonderful temperature I almost didn't even need salt or pepper. The cheeses worked great with the dish. Somewhere in the middle of my eating my server came over (as some one else had dropped off my food) and dropped the check. If you're looking for good food go here, good service, I'm sure there are better options."
i do when i m feeling a bit weird to reground myself
i feel like the only thing i can do sometimes is just be supportive and be there but i never feel like thats enough
i feel the cold stony surface underneath me
"Posto Panino seems to be a new place with a good amount of seating and a quick service takeout or dine in menu. The menu is basically Italian with a range of pizzas, sandwiches and pasta dishes.   The prices for the sandwiches seem reasonable until you start adding some toppings. Just a few extra additions can double the cost of the sandwich. An $8.00 veal sandwich comes out to $12 with cheese and mushrooms.   The taste was good and the environment is OK. What seems to be lacking is a bit of enthusiasm on the people who work there. They seem to be a bit ""unmotivated"". It's hard to describe, just one of those feelings.   Overall I think that Posto Panino will become a good quick casual spot in King City. I will definitely return when I'm the area to try some other dishes."
i feel disturbed and sad
i feel that i am rather faithful to make up brands especially when i find something that really works for me
i feel very shocked i have never expected that would happen to me
"I've been shopping at this GE for at least 15yrs.  It's convenient to work and home for me.  I think this location would be great for a makeover with all the urban redevelopment going on around it. I believe this store is corporate owned, so not sure if redevelopment is in the plans or not.  Evening check out lines can get pretty long.  Outside you can usually find people offering jitney services, selling food stamps or selling bootleg dvds lol!  A fresh seafood department would make this store much better.  I think this location is open from 6a-11p."
i still feel a little weird calling the ceo of my company bob but relented after he corrected me repeatedly
"For a Coco's on the outskirts of Las Vegas Blvd, this was not bad. I had the potato pancakes with sausage. The potatoes were not very crispy and a tad mushy on the inside but the flavor was ok. The sausage was delicious though! Service was nice and attentive and refilled our coffees and waters often."
i feel aggravated and tense because i have a need for the air in my personal space to be free of allergens i have asthma
"To sum it up: Nobu clone. Sake selection was impressive, but overpriced in a major way. Atmosphere is outstanding, and the room is quieter than Nobu (which can get extremely loud).   Shibuya markets itself as something of a sake destination. They have sake sommeliers who did an adequate job of suggesting bottles for us. As a sake fiend though, I found their selections a bit pedestrian and too safe. Big list though, so a good place to go for sake sampling if you are new to sake.   I won't go back, but only because I think my standards are higher for this price. Shibuya is obviously high-caliber style dining, but it just didn't strike me right for the price and what I got. I think the clumsy sake selection and insultingly overpriced sake list tainted my overall impression. Might go back to have a Sapporo and focus on the food if it's convenient."
i feel blessed and safe that nothing to terrible happened regarding the storms
i will probably feel a little offended which is why i don t do invites and if i won t eat your antibiotic and arsenic fed chicken and artificially garlic flavored box of potato flakes you will probably be offended

"MTL blog says that this is the one kebab place that you must check out in all of MontrΓ©al so my sister and I went there while we were in town. There is an upstairs and a downstairs and we got seated upstairs.   The host was super friendly but the server was a bit curt. Also, service was pretty slow. It took quite a while to get up to the table and get the drinks and everything else. The food itself was good. Not the best kebabs I have ever had but I lived in Germany and guess that I am more of a fan of Turkish/German/Belgian style than Iraqi style? We also got baba ghanouj (their spelling not mine) and it was good/ok. Maybe I should have gotten something else off the menu because it was all just good/ok. Finally we realized the server was not going to bring a bill (never mentioned it nor did he ever visit the table after dropping off the food) so we went downstairs and paid. Yes it was good but I would advise sitting downstairs and maybe not sticking to the basics as it seems there are many better things to eat than the kebabs."

"Bottom line:  this restaurant is all show.  We went in on a saturday night labor day weekend w/o reservations and ordered sirloin and ribeye with pork belly and heirloom tomatoes as starters.  waiter brings a huge plate of raw meat stacked on top of each other and begins explaining which one is which; this is a cool show but that's about it.  steaks were a bit overdone probably because the surface of the steak was real hard to begin with; i'm sure their meats were good, but just their cooking methods are questionable.  Pluses: oregon pinot was excellent, pork belly was better than the steak, heirloom tomatoes were great as well.  This is the 1st time that the starters were better than the entrees.  Alexander's and pinot brassiere are better imo."
i look into the news especially at these unsettling times sometimes i just feel so burdened to pray and cry out to god for the nations

"Everybody has seen this show in the multitude of television commercials. Experiencing it live is pretty cool. The show is well choreographed and somewhat short for the one-half hour wait for the show. It's a lot of water shooting up in the air, and once you see it, you'll need not go back."

I will go back but will verify what is in/comes with order so there aren't surprises. (such as broccoli, peppers, mushrooms and onions in my seafood chimi!)"
i seldom went to the office on saturday but he was feeling so strange that he thought a little work might clear his mind
"We visited Mac's for the first time tonight.  I'd often wondered how it was, but it's nearly impossible to lure my husband away from the ceasar salad at Wildflower.  But this weekend, Mac's is participating in Hoodstock and donating 10% of it's proceeds to my stepdaughter's school, so we gave it a try.    We waited for about 15 minutes for a table, but were able to get a snack for our girls and a couple beers while we waited.  Toddler meltdown averted.  RIght when they seated us, some friends of ours came in, also looking to have dinner.  We asked if our table could accommodate three more people and another baby, and since it couldn't they opened a bigger table for us in the back.  Pretty cool, if you ask me.  Once we ordered, it took a while for our food to get to us.  In their defense though, I think they were pretty slammed with additional business coming in from Hoodstock next door.  I ordered the spicy roast beef, my husband had the a California chicken sandwich (something along those lines) and our girls split some fish and chips (hold the chips, sub a side of fruit).  The spicy roast beef is no joke.  Now, I'm no stranger to spice.  I like my wings HOT, I add extra tabasco to my bloody Mary's, hell, I ate hot sauce straight out of the bottle when I was pregnant.  But this sandwich took it overboard.  Heat can be a good thing, but not when it's the ONLY THING you can feel in your mouth.  I couldn't even taste anything else in the sandwich.  Finally, I picked off the jalapenos and it was much more tolerable.  My husbands chicken sandwich was great, and the girls fish was mediocre.  Not the best, not the worst, but pretty good.  I'm not a fan of skinny little french fries.  There's just not enough potato for me.    But, the service was fine, considering it was a packed house with big parties and lots of kids in there.  And I have to give them props for donating money to Broadmor.  Next time we're in the area and in the mood for some eats and drinks, we'll stop in again."
i feel herpes coming i would be very surprised at this point if i make it out again after my checkup at the clinic on wednesday
i feel uncertain of what i am doing
i feel shocked and sad at the fact that there are so many sick people
i have invited these feelings to reside in a pleasant albeit windowless room at the top of an imaginary house and locked the door on them
i would say i get probably minutes from them i would probably get more if i didnt smack my lips so much but i cant help it these feel so lovely on my lips
i also feel that learning about the other thinking styles can help us to be more considerate and compassionate towards those who dont think the same way
i feel i keep trying to do what i can to be supportive of my family but when it comes down to it my own family my two girls my hubby and me well i just have to put us first sometimes
i was i admit very worried about feeling isolated i work in a cubicle pretty much on my own unless someone needs me
i continued to watch feeling a strange sense of unease i decided this new found trend wasnt for me
"Took my hunny here for his birthday today.....welll.............  So I had reservations at 6:15pm....the restaurant is somewhat hidden beneath a huge apartment structure so we drove around twice to find the parking structure...which had no visual signs. After parking we were trying to find an exit from the parking structure and when we finally surfaced the creepy underground parking lot, we had to go through a maze in the Arizona heat around the apartments for about 5 minutes before reaching the restaurant at the opposite end of the parking structure. I was in a black dress and heels and boy was I sweating. Once I got in there I light-heartedly said to the host ""Omg why is it so hard to find this place...I've been walking in a maze! Then he laughing said well it's good that you're here now and we'll quickly get you some ice water to cool u down and sat us down at a nice table.   So this was our first time here but I already kinda know how it works since I've been to other restaurants with tasting menus...but for this one they give you this orange sheet with the price listing for the number of courses you want and any thing you don't like you can cross out or write down. There is a minimum of 4 course for $50, 5 for $60, 6 for $70 and 7 for $80 and then there's the full tasting for $140 and a supplement of $15 if you want one of dish to be Foie Gras.   So my bf and I decided on 7 course and supplement a dish for foie gras. I don't  like alcohol but they had an option on their drink menu for non-alcoholic cocktails...so basically they would mix any cocktails without the alcohol so I thought that was pretty cool.  I started with a salad and my bf started with a soup..then the other dishes came out in between 15-20 minute intervals. I did not like the way they made the foie gras...because it had a sugar caramelized coat and was a bit too burnt..which to me ruin the foie gras. So I DO NOT recommend the $15 foie gras supplement. I also did not like the creme brulee dessert...it was too wet and I was not fond of the taste either. Other then that the other dishes was okay...it wasn't really mind-blowing.   The service wasn't spectacular....for the price I paid I expect beyond great service but eh our waiter was okay...he came with our dishes, explained it and then walked away...came back after we were done, took our plates and walked away again...it was a slow night too....there were only about 5 other couples there..and we each had our own servers so I think they could have done a better job.  The bill came out to be around $273....my bf didn't even have wine..just two Blue Moon beers. Overall I'm not too thrill about this place...it's only been opened for like 2 years and 8 months. I didn't mind spending the money but I do expect to get what I paid for...in this case I do not feel I have...sooo would I come here again? mmmmm maybe not.    FYI: Yelp says it's dressy and Opentable.com says it's causal elegant....Honestly it doesn't freakin really matter...my bf and I dressed up really nice...only to find that some other people were in regular polo shirts, jeans, shorts and filp-flops!! this really irritates me....at least try not to wear flip-flops at such an expensive restaurant! -_-"" And I find this the case in many of the fine dining restaurants I've been to..-_-"""""""""
i feel very offended when people discuss whether or not i am a
i have endless stress in managing staff exhaustion and frustration with running a business feeling that i am coping rather than caring for my children and immense irritation that every time i want to eat more healthily or do more exercise something comes along to wipe out all my good intentions
"We decided to check out the sister restaurant of Canteen Modern Tequila.  We were told a 20min wait... 50 mins later our party was seated.  We ordered the anti pasta which was tasty.  All of our pizza's were good, nice thinner crust and quality toppings.  Overall nice atmosphere, food is good but not special, slow service..."
"I've stayed here twice (15 years between visits), and don't really feel the need to stay here again unless the price is too good to pass up. Pros: room was clean; bed was comfortable; location was great. Cons: no mini-bar, fridge, or other amenities; only one chair; a couple of broken lamps, and shower curtain rod broke while we were there. I did like the workout room and spa, but do NOT visit the salon (Uno) as they're rip-off artists. The rest of the hotel -- casino, stores, restaurants, etc. -- were all fine but not great. In summary: Fine place to stay if the price is right, but you can do better on the Strip."
i am feeling miserable but c i am also the proudest mum on earth
"I've been to the Sushi Samba in Miami, and if I had to choose, I'd be in Miami in a heartbeat. The menu is interesting, and the variety is solid, but I wasn't impressed with the sushi.  The fish was fresh, but not cut well, and the rice was less than stellar.  The space is broken down into cool loops, so you can feel like you're in an intimate place, but take a look at the walls before you end up at a business meeting under the kabuki ""adult toy"" mural.    I was there with a pretty large group, and I can understand that food may come out a bit slowly.  However, they lost drink orders, which is a cardinal sin for a place with a bar menu that is as big as it is.  The little bites were tasty, and the few bits of Brazillian food that we had were solid. Not amazing, as there are much better ways to do a Brazillian steakhouse kind of menu, but no complaints on that.    What was good?  The environment and the drinks.  If that's what you want, it's more of a 4 star review."
i cant help but feel that the frantic rushing springtime will affect many of us in strange ways

"We've returned two years later, and I wasn't as WOWed.   First of all, their texting waiting system? They don't tell you that it takes another hour PAST the waiting time printed on your ticket for you to be seated. My ticket time said ""742pm"", which was literally 5 hours later, but we figured it was still fine and gave us time to still get ready before going out.   I get my text around 730 saying to head over to the podium. We get there, and are told to stand in the line just to pay. From the time we stood in line to the time we got seated, it was another extra hour. I feel like they should tell you this on the printed ticket, because it falsely makes you believe that you'll get in at a certain time. I was pretty annoyed by the time we sat.  The goods: Crab legs- they have them hot and cold, and if you ask the guy behind the table, he'll hand pick some good legs for you Nachos- love the nachos in the small saucer Baked potato- like the small size with cheese, bacon, and sour cream Mushroom truffle soup- pretty good flavor. One of the better soups I've had at a buffet Dessert crepe- you tell them what you want inside for the sauce, and top it with fruit and whipped cream. Delish  The bads: Asian food- yes, they have a large selection, but it's not good quality or that tasty. Their har gow was super mushy and not good Italian- total lack of italian food. Their pizza is lackluster and the only pasta they had was gemelli. Super mushy and overcooked  Crab ravioli- not good. Smelled fishy and the insides were so gross, I actually spit it out Prime rib- I didn't have any, but hubby and his cousin said it was tough and didn't taste good, and the cut was too small  I also was looking forward to some sweet potato tots and there were NONE! Very disappointed.   I don't remember bacchanal being like this when I went when they first opened, I feel like the quality has gone down. The wait all afternoon and night was not worth it, and if the wait was ever this long again, I wouldn't do it. I'd rather go to Wynn or Wicked Spoon."
i didnt feel pressured to move out of the way or get a move on
im feeling overwhelmed
i feel most romantic when its just the two of us hand in hand a couple without kids alone and free to just be together
i feel pretty resentful of the project at the moment

"We loved our food and the service the first time we went, however our visits were not consistent. The second time we went the server mixed up our order and the food wasn't very good even though we ordered the same thing the first time. It's a fun place to grab a drink and some food when watching a game, but don't have high expectations."
i was feeling really pleased with how i d looked after myself on the climb and got myself running again

i feel about these divisions is that they are fine as long as they are there to facilitate life for one and all
"The decor is so cute in here.  I've tried the avocado toast, the pear and goat cheese and the PB honey one.  The bread that they use is super soft and dense and overall I like the toast here. My only suggestion is that they should used a poached egg rather than hard boiled and it should be included in to the price.  One thing I really don't like is their smoothie prices. $9 for a small maybe 12-16 ounce smoothie is ridiculous. That's something I'd expect in the cosmo but not in the suburbs.  It's easy to feel kind of ripped off here. I'd come here every once in a while if I'm really craving it but overall just an average experience.  Btw you can make any of theses toasts EASILY at home, it's just a matter of if you're willing to pay for convenience or not."
i do however feel a tinge of regret now that i know how its damaged my abilities to breast feed
i feel so rude sometimes and i wonder why

"I have never ordered a pizza from here, I have only stopped in for by the slice goodness.   Small pizza joint, not aimed at sitting down. They have a by the slice thing and the rest is take out/delivery. There are usually a few kinds of by the slice 'za kicking around at lunch time, I usually stick to the usual suspects: hawaiian, pep, or cheese. I have to agree, the sauce is not great - it's too sweet and lacks the flavour required to compliment such a nice crust. There's nothing really wow about this stuff, other than the fluffy crust. If you're down with that - down with carb city - and want a filling lunch that will stave off the 3:30pm hunger pangs (and replace them with carbo groggines), this place has got you covered.   There's really no where to sit, they have a few chairs for waiting but I would feel odd eating there. Plan to get this on a nice day so you can pull up a patch of grass, or take it back to work, or take it away....  Convenience trumps here (its a quick walk from work) - and budget prices! $5.50 for 2 filling slices and a can o' soda."

"Alla Familia was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The amazing food and character of the restaurant was second to none.  Unfortunately I hadn't gone in a while and when I recently went I honestly thought I went through the wrong door.  They apparently added on and turned the new section into a fancy trendy feel.  I was so disappointed.  They took a masterpiece, and just in my opinion, ruined it.  It now has the same look and feel as all new modern steakhouses.  It would be better for for NYC than Pittsburgh.  I really am distraught how they could just do a 180 turn to the look and feel.  No longer cozy.  No more charm.  I hope they are doing well and I'm sure they are, but this place is no longer for me.  Sad to see it go."

"TAS is a good resource, and the sliding scale is good for community access. The practitioners are also nice, and good at making you feel easy. They are on time with their appointments.  However if you're getting back or shoulder blade treatment, this might not be the best place for you. The recliners are ok, but the lack of a table to lie flat on is sometimes problematic. I found in a sitting position I almost passed out, while in other places with the same treatment  but flat on a table I did not have this issue.  If you're good with sitting or reclining on your back, hit up TAS, if not, elsewhere might be more comfortable."
"Ahh....so,so. Greasy. Expensive. People were nice. Probably won't be back. Not worth the money."

"We wanted to try a new place other than Joey's at Shops on Don Mills so we gave Taylor's Landing a try. The staff was very nice and friendly and we were given a table after a few minutes even though it was a busy Friday night. We ordered the Burger, the Tempeh Sandwich and the fish taco. I wasn't very impressed with the tempeh sandwich. I don't know whether they don't know what chimichurri is or there was a mistake in the kitchen but my sandwich had pesto instead of chimichurri. That I didn't really mind but still the sandwich wasn't anything memorable and was very bland. The taco was ok and burger looked ok (I didn't try it).   I found the food and drinks to be way over-priced. They charge $13 for a mediocre sandwich and additional $4-5 for any sides such as fries. I had a glass of red wine which costed $13 for 5oz but it looked more like 3oz to me.   Overall I wasn't really impressed by Taylor's Landing even though I had very high hopes for it. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Prices: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5"
"Decent is a good word to describe this place. Decent food, decent service, decent atmosphere...   Food was different but not necessarily good different. Simple things like Mac and Cheese they didn't get quit right. A for effort but C for results."
"Had to stop in for a quick take out wrap. Liked the selection on the menu, and thought of doing something more traditional deli but settled for a turkey wrap.  Wasn't disappointed...big chunks of roast turkey with mayo and Swiss cheese made for a very filling wrap.  As a bonus, I happened to see a local celebrity ... none other than the ""Cash Man"" ...jeweller Russell Oliver...who had stopped in for a bite from his nearby store.  On the downside, I was in a bit of a time crunch but there was confusion by the staff as to who was actually serving take out customers and the wrap took longer than I thought was necessary.   The place is small and cozy which can be good or can be bad depending on what you like and how busy it gets."

"Review: 3.5 stars  I read great reviews about this bakery on Yelp, so I had to try it. The line is always busy and a bit unorganized. The desserts and pastries looked delicious! My hubby and I had a snack around 4pm. We tried two pastries: sugar and apple brioche. The pastries weren't bad, but you could tell that they were sitting out all day. It was a bit sweet, and I don't know if they are worth $4 each.  If I come back, I'll try the crepes since everyone raves about them.   This place opens late, so you can definitely come back for a late snack."
Raunchy. If it wasn't for the decent food and nice staff it would be rated lower. The food was decently priced and it tasted pretty good.nothing spectacular. Once staff decided we weren't ordering drinks they were less attentive but I guess it's expected. The crowd is pretty gross. Groups of older Women making out with everyone....everywhere. I was mostly irritated when they tried to include me. Yuck. Wouldn't visit again.
i hated growing up i have no good memories of a life as an innocent child only the feeling of being hated and worthlessness consume the memories

"So, my friends and I decided to make our way to this place on a late afternoon last Saturday.  As we walked closer, we saw the pink start to switch our decision to go, but I said, 'Whatever, let's go'.  My motivation was the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It being the time it was, I decided to get the NY Hot Dog.  And to my disbelief, it turned out to be a foot long.  I wasn't really surprised because I already read reviews and knew what I was getting myself into.    The dog tasted good, but not when you have the Fr'HC to relieve your liquidity.  The Fr'HC was like a normal Chocolate Frap, just a bit more sweeter and no coffee taste.  Oh, and it costed like $9.    We didn't wait for a seat, we just ordered outside and ate in front of Caesar.  I would need to order something besides the norm to give a better assessment on S3.  But, hey, they're OK."
"It's not 1993 and the Excalibur is no longer the gem of the strip. With places like the Cosmo, Wynn, and Aria classing things up and doing things to suit a younger crowd, the Excalibur is definitely dates. It seems old and dirtier, and like it caters to the families now.   But the Excalibur is by no means bad. Its perfectly okay as far as cheep hotels on the strip go. For my non-existent college student budget I'll take a $20 room any day over actually spending money to stay somewhere awesome on the strip. It's worth the walk to and from the castle to stay so cheep on Las Vegas Blvd.   The rooms are nice sized and really all you need from a room. The casino is okay. The price tho makes it well worth my recommendation."
i am feeling paranoid and not wanting to leave the house

"Came here for a movie tonight only because AMC Forum at Atwater stopped showing what I was going to see. It's a bit of a haul as I took two metros and a bus to get here! I got here to buy my ticket early and was really disappointed in the atmosphere of the theater entrance- it was kind of depressing. No ticket machines, somewhat awkwardly placed ticket booths, and complete desolation other than the people in the ticket booths. Also, what is very annoying is that they don't take debit cards. Be forewarned! Credit cards and cash only, but there are two RBC ATMs in the entrance, so that is convenient. Seats in the theaters are very very comfortable but the reason I would give them three stars out of five is because the hard plastic back makes it so that you will hit your head on it if you want to rest your head back. I did as soon as I sat down and it was a real damper on the feeling of great comfort I felt as my butt hit the cushion. A good theater, but they can improve here and there!"
i am and im not attending as you read in my last post but feel very blessed for the limited interaction i do get to have
i realised how sick i was of working and feeling and being alone

"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel maybe 4-5 times, and at the Cabana suites twice. (Cabana review on their separate yelp page.)  For the main hotel, we've stayed at both the Tower rooms and the original rooms. The over-arching feeling I have, is that this place is really cool. You HAVE to appreciate the Cortez being one of the last of the original hotels/casinos in Vegas. If your into that more than anything, stay in the original rooms. Your room will have a tiny hint of years of nicotine, and a slightly audible sound track of all the action down stairs. (Especially in the bathroom.)  Personally, we're a little less keen on the smoke and noise; so the tower rooms fit the bill. Relatively new, well done decor, kind of reasonable prices for room service; and okay service. The shower has a small window that you can open if you like, which I found extremely nice/interesting. (Others might not.)  The Cafe has ALWAYS been a favorite. The food is actually REALLY good and has some of the most reasonable prices in Vegas. Service has always been really sh*tty, so just be prepared. If the cafe had a personality, it would be like Rainman's other talent was cuisine. The food is really good, but then the rest of the experience is enough to make you roll your eyes. Here's the formula: when you sit down, wait 5-7 minutes for your order to be taken, then wait 12 minutes. When your food arrives, they slap down your check, and aren't to be seen again. Really guys? (One last rip on the cafe service... if they had Keno runners, they'd probably make more money off of me. That would be nice.)"
i can really stick to it but i m feeling positive
i mean i was feeling really passionate and confident about it in the moment but maybe im way off here
i was feeling more than a little hesitant about the idea of moving to texas
i hate seeing boys cry it makes feel so ridiculously uncomfortable lol
i feel supporting walker and giving him his space
i feel in retrospect if i have the ability to think back that all this history stuff and the miles upon miles of newsprint that has carried my feature articles impressed and impacted the readership the way it was intended
i feel like i cant go out to dinner anymore because i never liked many foods to begin with and now that im a gluten free vegan there are even less options
"Note: As of writing in Sep 2015, this place has been renamed to Sunfood Supermarket (η™Ύη¦θ¶…η΄εΈ‚ε ΄).  I only managed to get some of the items I wanted, and the shopping experience was somewhat disappointing. Many vegetables for sale were clearly not fresh (yellowing, damaged, etc.), and I ended up having to go to another supermarket to fill in the items I skipped here. Beside the bakery department is a spooky defunct counter for sushi and sweet drinks. I remember the times about 2 years ago when this store was Oriental Food Mart and it was livelier with customers, there were more products being offered, and the produce was fresher. Now this place can only be described as offering cheap groceries (not necessarily good) and slowly going downhill."
I used a Groupon here for lunch on a weekday and had their lunch special and an appetizer. The service was attentive enough and the food came promptly. I ordered pad Thai - the portion was large but I didn't actually enjoy it very much...
i still feel so alone i just cant give you anything for you to call your own and i can feel you breathing and its keeping me awake can you feel it beating
i feel fine live in germany remastered
i feel intimidated i also feel very much at home with all of them
i always like to sneak a smell when i am holding them because the vanilla fragrance it s so soothing and makes me feels nostalgic
i feel i should mention my precious toddler who was acting like her life would be over if she didnt get sleep now just woke up after only hrs of sleeping

id love to chat with ya so feel free to leave a comment or email me at skinnychickblog gmail
"So happy to have a Popeyes close to my place. I got some crazy good coupons in the mail for their opening.  5 pieces of chicken, two sides and two biscuits for 5.99.  That's enough food for this lady for a few days. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. My only complaint was the chicken was a little salty.  Less is more.. Other than that the food was great as usual."
i thought about giving up for crying out to one of my supports as i was feeling highly agitated
i say the first bite revealed it to me and from this moment i feel absolutely compassionate for all those people who would spend their last cent on these round little pieces of heaven
"We went to KiWe Kitchen for some beverages and drinks. The ambiance was pleasant and the servers were nice. We had an assortment of martinis and beers and they seemed to do a good job on those items.   The desserts, a tiramisu and a chocolate tort, were not bad and worth trying. It might be a place to try for dinner and the restaurant was busy during the 9:00pm hour.  Its just an A-OK for now! Good luck."
i can feel the strokes getting harder and faster as i try in vain to find that release
i too feel as if i am a stranger in a strange land and i am raising my son in a place that is not his father s ancestral home
"I've only been inside once for a jar of Nutella.  I know, kinda strange that I would stop at Yusef's for a jar of Nutella but I live right by the place and every deli has Nutella (and Yusef's did too, see-- I told you).  Anyhow, I like this place for one really odd reason-- my Dad buys cherry juice at Yusef's by the case-- he says it helps his kidney stones.  My dad likes the owner and I think they are nice to him, so I am happy about that.  I would like to try some of the fresh food they make, I'll need to make sure I take mental note to do so."
im not going to say out whats going through my mind i just know that i feel so fucked
i do feel strange about preferring to go to my spin community rather than my lutheran community
im feeling a little better today
i feel very fond of him what with his strong independent spirit
i keep feeling pleasantly surprised at his supportiveness and also his ease in new situations
i end up feeling more insecure about my body and every fucking minute i spend trying to look ok while running on that treadmill
"We stopped on in after an event at Discovery Place. It was relatively busy, as it was a Friday night, but the restaurant is huge and can accomodate many parties. They have a great bar/table area, and then more booths/tables towards the back of the restaurant. Right now they have a great deal going on for their beer samples where you get 6 samples for $5. Their menu offers a wide variety so it appeals to vegetarians, meat/burger lovers, those looking for smaller portions, and even has some good looking desserts as well. I had the waldorf chicken salad, which was pretty good. The baked apple crisps were a unique change from the norm. My husband had the 2 am burger, which comes with a fried egg, bacon and hashbrowns - it was a nice, thick burger and really appeals to you if you are hungry. The fries were ok - nothing special. Service was ok, as it took 20 minutes to get our beers delivered, but it was a busy Friday, and apparently the bar was low on glasses."
ill admit to feeling a bit apprehensive everyone time someone i know buys my book
i had a feeling he probably still hated me for my confessions a couple months ago
i should be feeling nostalgic but i think im ready to see jax off once and for all
i don t tend to do this but i m feeling generous we have a new member in the community who posted in yesterday s green room
i realized that i was feeling offended and belittled by this man for something that was entirely out of my control his opinion of women based on his mother
i was feeling pretty fearful of speaking again but now im realizing that im past that
i feel like a single parent sometimes who has a roommate who is fond of the baby
"We stopped in to Maya's on a road trip going off of other Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was nice. We were greeted immediately and seated in a large booth. Our server was very friendly and took our order pretty quickly. I had the chicken enchiladas. They were not the best I've ever had nor the worst. Better than fast food Mexican for sure. Husband got the Chile Rojo. He said it was good, but the sauce was a little too ""tomatoey"" for his taste and he would have liked more spice. Over all it was a decent experience."
i had my first meeting last week and i m feeling very inspired positive and enthused about taking my business forward
i almost feel your touch that caress so gentle and soft like angels wishes and memory as it strokes along my spine electing chills beneath my reality
i had a feeling i was doomed when i discovered i liked doing pap smears on family medicine
i think it was i don t guarantee i m recollecting this accurately my interest is in the yearning feeling not the supporting details so if someone is interested in the details they should check them out themselves and i was so surprised by how he precessed his experience
i felt it would make him feel that i am suspicious about his life
i get the feeling he is telling peter many people will be surprised
i feel like an emotional train wreck
im the solo follower at the moment but i have a feeling theres going to be some terrific stuff on there in no time
i would hesitate feel uncomfortable and generally answer by saying that i liked cycling running reading photography and gardening
i love my eyes and i think the rest of my face comments them as well but i feel like people overlook the face i have and are distracted by my body
i am feeling much more energetic and happy
"The omatcha black sesame latte is where it's attttt.. I'm gonna go ahead and say that the flavours just go well together since they're both pretty gritty and have that bittersweet taste. The added sugar helps fuse them together and you can definitely tell the distinction between the two. There was only a $0.50 cent difference when it came to the Medium ($5.50) and Large ($6.00), so I just went for the large.  Staff friendly, service timed pretty well, but the seating area is cramped asf unless you sit at the actual table; not to mention the booth chairs are ridiculously high, so it may be a bit of a challenge for short people getting seated and coming back down - as was the case with me =*c"
i am feeling very blessed and grateful these days as we keep our friends in ny and nj in our thoughts and prayers
ive watched the brainwashed penis vid more times since last night and feel even more horny and pointy
"Well, fiddlesticks: inconsistency is never a good thing at a restaurant. That's why people (not me, but some) eat P.F. Chang's. They know what they're getting.   After our most recent delicious plate of snow peas, we decided to return, and this time, the snow peas were missing that addictive flavor. They weren't as sweet, nor as seasoned with wok-iness. I ate them, but I wasn't compelled to eat them faster than my husband to ensure I had more (which I did last time!). We also ordered a noodle dish, and it seemed a tad dry although the flavor was solid. I still think the nice sized, $4 miso soup is a good value on the Strip, but it doesn't have seaweed. Still, for $4 it is a cheap way to sustain yourself!  So, this update is here to say depending on who's in the kitchen, you may have a 3-star meal or a 4-star meal, but I still think the key is going for the cheaper stuff!"
i have moments where i want to update and write a little something in this blog but i always feel like the time devoted to typing and getting into detail on something spectacular or painful seems like too much of an ordeal
i dont want to say i feel restless but i guess thats the best way to put it
i woke up feeling a bit apprehensive before the upcoming day
i feel like a bit of a strange one
i still feel a bit intimidated when i go to these mets bloggers events
i really didn t feel like going i was furious it s just that pictionary
i can be or what i think and feel that i can like violent pictures and boys kissing boys but there was an understanding that it was kept in its box

i would post the emails he sends me until i feel trusting enough to give him his own account
"They have skinny mirrors!  I just wish I really looked as good in reality as I do in the mirrors at Everything But Water... but alas, even without skinny mirrors in real life, my mission to find a tankini type of bathing suit was accomplished after a quick visit to this EBW location.  Katy helped me out and was extremely helpful - especially considering she was the only one working during my visit.  Selection wasn't as amazing as I would have liked, but they supposedly have even more styles online.  They do have a good variety of colors, styles, prints, etc... and the beauty of this place is that you can purchase different size tops and bottoms if need be.  (Mix and match if you will.)  Prices were on the higher side as well, but sometimes a girl has to splurge, and that's what I did since I don't think I'd bought a new bathing suit since about 1999.  (Okay - I may be exaggerating a bit, but all of my bathing suits other than my new purchase are really old!)  If you're looking for a new suit, EBW is a great place to start!"
i could just learn how to feel and think that a tranquil life that doesnt involve the cops and drug overdoses and forgetting myself and the constant risk of death etc
i feel it in the warmth of your tender embrace its the feeling i get when i think of our unborn children wanting to have them through you why do i love you because you and i are soul mates
i dont know where i want to work because there will always be something that makes me feel stressed or anxious at work whatever the job may be as all jobs require some sort of rules or pressure
i feel the gentle waves of peace flowing across my mind
i feel like not enough people my age actually think that most are pretty devastated that their s have come and gone
"A friend of mine, suggested that we go here based on her past experience.  We ordered several items while we chatted: Ceasar salad, garlic bread, fried mushroom, zucchini & mozzarella sticks and the combo pizza.  The combo appetizers were a bit over cooked/deep fried for my taste.  Everything else was good.  The service was quick and the waitress was very friendly.  I would have no problems coming back."
im feeling extraordinarily dazed and bewildered this arvo for no particular reason and my muscles all hurt even though i dont actually have any
i am afraid that once again i will feel hopeless and lose all of the peace that i gained after my last episode
i feel probably too acutely for the tender age of that life is too short for all the living it deserves
i still feel sleep deprived she is almost sleeping through the night giving us
"Likes: Good dilworth location, little to no wait for a table, food served quickly, mimosas and bellinis are delicious and a good size for the price    Gripes: Omelets are odd. The eggs are fully cooked and then the other ingredients - cheese, vegis, etc - are entirely separate from the eggs and just folded in between plain cooked eggs. I have never had omelets like this anywhere else and the food came out so quickly that it makes me wonder if the eggs are not precooked and they just stuff the ingredients in when the order is placed. Bloody marys are mediocre. At my most recent visit, our one particular server was rude but I have not experienced this before so I am not sure what to make of that.   Bottom line: If you're in the area, it's a good place to grab a decent breakfast but this is not a restaurant that I would seek out."
"Good food, great atmosphere and good service. The only really bad thing I can say, is that they are way over priced for what you get. Nice little spot to have a nice meal with your lady if you have some extra money to burn."
Went here for dinner and although the food was good it was not great. The prices were about average for Vegas but the portions were much smaller since it was a Tapas Restaurant. The service was wonderful and was probably the best part of the whole meal. Lastly if you had to get anything the chocolate makeout was the best part of the meal.
im feeling threatened i told him with my palms raised
im totally walking on sunshine feeling lighter and less burdened by excess weight but then people snicker or i get on the bus and people would rather stand than sit next to me and im reminded of how much work i still have to do

i recently did an activity in our university christian union cu where we looked at the fears and reasons we have that make us feel apprehensive about talking about our faith and god s love for us to those who do not know the lord
"The first time I came to this buffet was probably in 2002. My parents took me here so all I remember was that I was complaining about standing in what seemed to be a long line. Being it was my first ""pricey"" buffet I also have memories of stuffing myself silly with crab and shrimp cocktail. Everything was pretty decent.   However, now a days I try not to over stuff myself so I'm not sure I would go again for that reason only. I'd probably opt fo the buffets at Mandalay Bay or Paris before this one."
i don t feel god s gentle hands pushing me one way i don t feel that warm gentle breeze of the holy spirit tickling the hairs on the back of my neck enveloping me and carrying me to the right path
i do realize that this is a unique situation and is by no means representative of the majority of amazing birth moms out there who make hard decisions in the best interests of their children but i can t help but feel jaded by the experience
i dont hold myself to days a week because i know with work thats unattainable so i try to keep it to days a week because i feel like that gives me room to breathe and i dont get annoyed with myself for not doing it everyday
i liked my keyboard being kicked in my teeth and feeling lousy about myself as a writer but because i want to know how i can improve and wonder what i did wrong to earn only one star

i know gay analogy but i am feeling weepy
i feel like that obnoxious kid thats trys to be a friend but all they are just annoying
"The service started out really nice. Our server took great care of us initially. She was prompt and polite. It was wonderful. Then I placed an order to go. Good grief. It took longer for the 1 to go order than it took for the 3 of us to eat initially.   The food was pretty good. The muffins, as everyone says, were delicious.  I had a bandito scramble. It had a lot of cheese and just didn't look like what I expected for the items that were supposed to be in it. It was delicious though. In addition, the potatoes that came with it were wonderful!  My daughter has the Mexican omelet. She was in seventh heaven....eyes rolling, lips smacking, spoon licking heaven. Who could blame her? The food was really good!  The wait for our take out, and the aggressiveness of the manager cost them a star. I thoroughly recommend coming here, just be prepared to wait a minute or two."
i feel privileged that god has given me gifts beyond the furthest reaches of my imagination in the physical form of my children
i get a similar feeling when i go on those depression forums and you get people saying but my partner is sooo supportive caring and helpful to me

i cant feel the xmas mood in other popular areas of tokyo such as ginza amp omotesando as the xmas lightings were so pathetic almost non existence

i think she knows how i feel about her and i guess i mostly know how she feels about me which is why i m hesitant to stay i could live there
i will never be a christian so the meaning of christmas to me is purely secular and when i am feeling rebellious a little bit pagan
"You get a lot of food here! My friend and I had both ordered a box each and it was way too much for us to finish in one sitting. We ordered:  - Hog and Scallop ($19.20)  - The Soul in a Bowl ($15.50)  Both items were very tasty, but we both felt that the box was filled up with more potatoes than needed. The ratio of carb to protein and fiber was disproportionate. I think I would have given it more stars if there were more veggie and protein to offset the amount of carbs. All in all, it was very tasty!! And I would definitely dine here again.  The service here was great! The staff here was very friendly and perhaps one of the nicest people we have met at a restaurant. Perhaps because we're both from California and people seem to rush more where we live."
im sick of feeling crappy
ive been thinking about turbulence and the way we pass through landscapes and the moment the air changes and we feel it and something uncertain unknown rises up to the surface

"Ok not amazing but pretty good. We've had several things beef is meh, chicken lo mein-noodles good but chicken meh, general Tso good, egg rolls very good,  pork ribs very good.   Still looking for ""the one"" for Chinese places but this is ok for now."
i think about having to see shigeru again the sicker i feel i have been so agitated that i forgot to water the bird and the pitiful sight of her pecking at the little bowl in her cage was my reward upon waking from what little sleep i had this morning
i want to feel passionate about something again
i feel like im tortured by beauty at times like seeing the sky with no way to be in it
i would hold her hand and re assure her enable a sense of safety and security when she mistakenly misperceived danger in situations which could cause her to feel fearful fear of abandonment fear of being alone fear of the unknown fear of getting it wrong due to a natural child like immaturity
i was still having some contractions but i was feeling slightly defeated
Pretty decent seafood but also a little pricey! We tried the crab sandwich which was actually an entire crab that had been deep fried on a bun. Definitely one of the better meals on the menu!
i feel annoyed and agitated
im feeling a lot more confident walking outside
i feel a tad bit annoyed and relieved at the same time is that underneath the armor and mask shes still the girl in article
i feel crammed and rushed around and everywhere and not really there because im always doing something and i feel lost in all the moving and doing of the things

i didnt really feel that embarrassed
i very rarely feel rushed
"Although I am not a big fan of buffets, Le Village Buffet had in the past was always pretty good.  Unfortunately, this time around it was mediocre, just another Vegas buffet.    One of the things I like in a buffet is the seafood bar.  Unfortunately, the selection this time around was limited and the Alaskan crab just didn't seem that fresh or tasty.  Moreover, the carving station was not all that great, the prime rib was average.  Upside, big desert bar and plenty of selections."
i just feel like i am not sure i will get there
i want him to be he feels frantic or overexcited and hes working his mouth and neck in that weird racehorse way

i feel like my life sucks and no matter how much i daydream of meeting this hot guy who will take care of me for a change and sweep me off my feet i think that dream boat got married to somebody else or he may have come to terms with his being gay
i feel like i owe all my faithful readers an explanation since all of you must ve been sooooo disappointed without my blog sarcasm off
i do know is that even though its hard and sometimes we feel inadequate drained and like we cant go any further and just need a break even for a week or two
I've been coming to this restaurant for years and recently the service just keeps going downhill. The waitresses rarely come back or even make eye contact after bringing your food. Hard to get refill or takeout boxes or even your check for that matter.  The food is still good it's just the service. I'm going to find a new Mexican restaurant and give Raul and Theresa a long break before I try it again.
i have come to this very same point that of seeing the poor and feeling for them seeing the church and longing to serve them and seeing christ and desiring him and i have determined im ready to give up how im living now to follow christ with my whole heart soul mind and strength
"We had to wait because they only had one server.  Several people came in and left when they were told they were understaffed.  The waitress was odd to say the least.  She was not talkative at all and did several odd things. She brought the food and held a plate and just hovered it above the table for us to move stuff and never said a word.  I asked for a refill and received one but she never asked my friend.  She brought containers to the table and then came back and took some of the containers and gave them to another table.  I told her we needed three and she said oh I shouldn't of taken them :/ she asked us several times if we were ready to put the food in the containers and we said we were still chatting that we would do it soon.  She came over another time and started putting the food in the containers and slopped the noodles everywhere.  There were several noodles in the bread basket and on the table.  The food was fabulous but wow, Krista must of been having an off day.  I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe the other server called in sick and she had to come to work when she wasn't planning on it.  It was just odd.  I'll probably return to see if the service improves."
i was eating my lunch and just listening to it made me feel like gagging of course i have this problem that i like to call sympathetic hyperventilation vomiting
i saw the video of cena kissing maria and surprisingly i didnt feel like i hated her
"I love the concept of this place, and the selection of clothing, shoes, and accessories are always unique and fun.  My gripe? They rarely take anything I bring in and the cash value is never worth it. I have much better luck at other shops of similar nature, so I'm not sure if its my timing or what. I am definitely more of a seller than a buyer, so this store unfortunately is just okay for me.  If you like finding treasures, I highly recommend stopping by frequently. I have found some amazing designer shoes and jeans here.  But if you're looking for quick cash, don't get your hopes up.  Some of the staff is awesome, especially Emily!!!  Other staff members, I sometimes question their buying process. I once watched them pass on an amazing designer bag which I then bought in the parking lot from the disgruntled seller for a smokin deal!! Their loss was definitely my gain that day!"
i wasnt supposed to be with n to just let it happen so i could feel the hurt and move on and be with who i was supposed to be with
i feel almost disgusted of myself
i was feeling so anxious to be back home
"Checked out The Patio after seeing the reviews and a feature in some article about it being a ""hot place"" to eat in Vegas now.  I'm from Toronto, so we have quite a few of these places scattered throughout the city.  HOWEVER, I must add that I don't think the Toronto places offer homemade ice cream or cakes that look relatively homemade.  We do have a fair share of tea places, so after following the hype, I thought this place was just OK.  Perhaps my impression would've been better if I had tea/piece of cake, but I was absolutely stuffed, so decided on homemade ice cream instead.  It was very good, nice texture, but they had run out of 1 out of the 2 toppings I selected.  Menu is somewhat limited and I've posted it so you can see their offerings.  It's basically an Asian tea place - NOT boba/bubble tea, that offers both hot/iced teas (~$5ea), with a handful of desserts including Asian inspired cakes, HK waffles, toast with some accoutrements, etc. but furnished in a way to look as if it's outdoors.  A great addition would be a green tea/sesame soft serve machine.  I think that would be a nice addition to the menu!  Service was just ok too.  Nothing memorable."

"Came to Toronto for a few days to explore (but mainly to eat) and hot pot was one of the first things in our checklist. Long story short, this place left a bitter taste in my mouth (literally).  Walked in with a group of 7 and were seated very tightly in a couch area when we easily could have sat in the round tables. This made for a VERY uncomfortable meal. Minus half a star.  We began ordering, but before we did, we had to order the Broth which was not a problem. I opted for the mild legendary spicy broth. I warn you, that the spicy broth isn't spicy because of the broth but because of the damned chiles and those weird balls on the bottom. I personally wasn't familiar with this because I've never had hotpot before (I know, right?) but being asian, I guess it was as if I would have been used to this? No one told me that if I ate the little balls with the chile on the bottom (which, apparently you're NOT suppose to?) that my entire mouth would become numb for several minutes. I ended up scooping out all the chile and the things on the bottom and diluted the crap out of it with water. So.. long story short; maybe opt for the broths that are NOT labeled the ""Legendary spice"" even if it says mild.   The food was very good. The vegetables, the meat, especially the lamb, beef and pork were delicious. The shrimp was fresh and juicy, I loved it all. The only thing that bothered me the most was the lack of attention to my table. My group and I were low on broth at least 2-3 times while we were there for 2 hours and never did a worker come by to pour more broth. I, was flabbergasted by the horrible service because we had to flag down waiters multiple times and they said ""it's coming"" and we proceeded to wait at least 15+ mins, while they checked their phones. Minus 1/2.  Another thing is that the workers failed to get our order and had forgotten it twice?? Like.. how? I mean, we gave them the slip with everything on it, but just had forgot to put it in.. twice. It took so much effort from my group to get at least decent service.. So this was a full star off.  The only thing that saves this place is the food. I really enjoyed everything that we ate and I hope that this was a one time thing so that if we ever come back, maybe the service will be better."
i feel bitchy in a way nwadays
i am feeling really agitated and there is sooo much within me bursting to come forth
im here it usually makes me feel carefree
This is the epitome of dive bar in Scottsdale. The servers are great. The prices are bit steep for this place. Never over crowded and a pretty friendly customer base.
i should get a job since i feel like impulse buying of dvds and books on amazon is an acceptable way to spend time
i really liked this one too more of a straight up fantasy feel to it which i liked
im feeling a little stressed
i didnt feel that their words were sincere
i finally feel excited to continue to try to lose some weight
i just lost my ipod nano so im feeling a little nostalgic
i am that is it really makes me feel reluctant some times or some the other times too
i feel dirty and cheap just talking about going this far
i can feel that we are supporting each other
when i heard a rumour that the st year exam results were out i had fear that i might be one of the failures
i feel like an idiot and a selfish asshole for even complaining
i have made some progress with it but i have a strong feeling it might just be next years motto as well
i do decide to dip my toe in another genre it feels a little strange which is the case with my recent project
i too might have a difficult time feeling sympathetic
i am feeling a little overwhelmed but ive been given some amazing tools met some wonderfully creative fun and crazy people and was reminded that i have a voice that has been silent for too long
I have never been in this place.! But I plan on it.  I am lying in bed right now. I am 6 feet tall.
i feel the need for something sweet around or at night and that used to end up with a late night run for ice dream or oreo cookies from the grocery store down the street
i want to hold this feeling of shocked awe and wonder forever
i feel frustrated and tried and confused and i do not want to take these damn meds i do not want to have to go to therapy or doctors all the time
"I'm so sorry Susur, please forgive me.  I heard that this is one of your favourite spots for pho, but it really didn't impress me.    This just isn't the best pho in the city.  Maybe a few beers at Dakota would change my mind. Perhaps a tequila flight or two from Reposado would make me more star generous... But even drunk and starving, I don't think I would change my mind. It's a perfectly average bowl of pho.  We wandered in here on a rainy day for a steamy hot bowl of broth. The place was busy for a mid-week gloomy evening.  Pho places on the Ossington strip look a lot like grimy run-down pho places in Chinatown. The floor was seriously filthy, they had the standard plastic utensils, and decor was basic and lacked any kind of effort.    Looked promising.  We started with the spring rolls. Super small. Not much to them, really.   Tasty... now bring me 3 more of them.  The pho wasn't bad at all, don't get me wrong.   The broth was a bit light and thin...but tasted good with a hint of cinnamon and sweetness.   Definitely not enough meat. I just wasn't satisfied.  I'll give this place another shot.  But, I may make a trip to Golden Turtle first."
i feel like i should be supportive but the art and music are really pretty mediocre
i tend to stay with colors most of the time a because i feel slightly naughty when wearing them b with my hands in latex gloves for most of my days at work it sometimes discolors light polish c my dark denim also always stains my light polish too for the lovely i just dug myself out of a grave look
i couldnt control it and what is worse is that no matter what i feel for her how deeply i feel for her or how sincere i amabout my feelings she wont listen to a word i say
"Was in town so stopped by based on the yelp reviews. Thought everyone was pleasant with generous portions and decent prices but honestly, nothing really special. Would eat here again if I was in town but it's not worth a special trip IMO."
i can t lift my knee as high as i think i should be able to during pt i acknowledge why i m feeling frustrated and then in the words of cher before she slaps nicolas cage in moonstruck i say to myself snap out of it
Finally opened a new place here! been way too long....My friend suggested that we come here for dinner. I didn't even know Golden Harvest even took over this place. I enjoy the fact that there is photos for every item on the menu. It makes my life so much easier because I can't read simplified chinese..  The food was A-OK...nothing really wow'd me in terms of the food. Everything was just OK. Nothing super delicious that was memorable.  We ordered quite a bit of food. The portions were decent.   I may be back when I am in the area but I won't go out of my way to come
i worked in a harbour and emptied latrine containers from the back of the lorries
i have the right to feel insulted
i feel like they hated me but i m too scared to listen to the tape
i feel a little less gloomy a little more optimistic or a little better prepared to face what life throws my way
i feel really discouraged and hope is the only thing i have to hold onto
i feel so exhausted from dealing with drama between other authors that i dont have energy to write
i feel like it will remain strong because of the quality of the food it is serving

i save the smaller ones for my ass but if i am feeling really horny a nice hard carrot will take me where i need to go
"We had the snow crab special and the 4 course meal with the new pork chops. Server was very helpful with descriptions and recommendations. Crab was as expected and the sauce for the pork was very good. Also, key lime pie! Not a bad night out at this location."
"It used to be really good here when it first opened, but the prices have gone up. Still come here now and again to meet friends over a pint.... But they should consider having more specials. Tourist trap mainly though, so most likely they won't."
i would say to mira i am feeling really curious about what its like to live in a castle and im looking it up on my computer
"Not magical food.  The decorative elements are amazing. Harry Potter style. Friendly staff. I had the fried chicken and it wasn't a good choice. It came barely burnt, with a bitter crust. The corn bread tasted nothing and was kinda dry. It was so greasy that even the generous lime salad wasn't capable of waving the grease taste from my mouth at the end of the dish. Going to a muggle restaurant next time!"
im sorry that you feel that way but hes my husband and im kinda fond of him
i write this note i am enjoying the sounds of danceable world music from sudamerica feeling glad that south american fusion music will be among those genres of the new earth
This is a traditional Taiwanese deli. Some of the food only come with small portion. I had  a baked beef pocket bread and a spicy cucumber for lunch.  It was a quick lunch and the price is good and the service was bad.  It's not recommend for whole family to dine in. But it's ok for a quick meal.
"Got a regular-sized jerk chicken.  Half of the tray was chicken, the other half split between rice and coleslaw. The meat was a bit on the salty side, but there was definitely some spicy.  I was expecting something bigger, but it's a decent meal for almost $11."
i have been feeling really distraught lately
i was feeling quite impressed with myself for taking just eight months to finish just the lyrics for one fairly simple though sufficiently tortured emo song
im feeling slightly agitated today and i cant be assed to be put in a better mood
i think we deserve a day that feels to me devoted to gathering harvest and peace
i was scared that gina would feel nervous at school
i should have known she likes kamiki kun he laughs nozomi feels an unpleasant knot in her stomach you must think i m a fool don t you nonchan
i feel nothing more than a fond regard for a dear colleague
i need to remember that first thing in the morning when i wake up and feel agitated and worry that the ritalin will make me more so
i define success by a large amount of people being able to feel something in my music and then in turn supporting it
im feeling absolutely amazing
"Green goddess ($6.99) has an initial sweet taste from the juice but has a veggie aroma and leaves aweird veggie sweet bitterness on your tongue afterward. Not exactly a taste I'm used to but it's okay. The drink comes with a Vega one protien powder which is plant based instead of milk so, it is vegan friendly. I don't think the protien was fully mixed into the drink though cause I found a clump of it after finishing the drink. Butter coffee ($3.99) does have a rich buttery taste I can identify especially the aftertaste on the tongue. The butter flavour sort of makes the bitterness of the coffee tolerable. Every time, someone opens the door, the cold of winter goes straight through the cafe. There is no vestibule and the door closes really slow. There are approx 7 tables of seating in the cafe. Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon. No music. As someone not into health food, this may not the best place to get a drink."
i feel like i m training in honor of my beloved feral cat family momma katherine p
i am feeling very productive d was yours a busy one around the home
i am both proud of it and insecure enough that i lean on that shit sometimes when i feel threatened
i feel like you bizzoers are going to be very compassionate with my plight and your support and readership and brilliance will get me through this trying time
i was feeling beaten up by life yesterday you see i am in love with a schizofrenic man who i had to kick out of my house for having boisterous fights with himself
i do feel sympathetic to the parties involved now that their careers are down the drain
i feel like i was tortured
i was surprised she even sat through the entire hours i was feeling less sympathetic
i also feel like my sinuses are really tender
"not impressed. our waitress did the absolute bare minimum. my soda was completely flat, i had to swap it for an iced tea. we ordered the garden pizza and it had no flavor! our kids' pepperoni was way better. not worth the $50+ we paid. :/"

i hate rap and i hate the fact that advertisers feel the need to make commericals for people who they feel arent intelligent enough to speak and understand english
"Second time here. They are open 24 hours a day! My bf and I met friends here last night. They have a nice outdoor seatings but the weather was cold.  They have a good choice of craft beers in Las Vegas and better selection of quality beers. The waitress says the beers on tap on the menu changes every three days. They also do events so check their website for current tap list and special events.  If you like video poker then this is also a very ok place to hang out.  They have a discount at happy hour.  I had a glass of Riesling. My friends had Nachos and cheese. We tried Candied bacon, it tasted like Teriyaki bacon and we didn't like it.   The music was loud and noise level was high.  Our waitress is very attentive and friendly.  Overall, this is a pretty average bar. I don't feel like there's a real reason to go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area then it's worth a visit."
"We stayed at the Monte Carlo and this was right outside of it.  Wanted to try their rainbow latte, which is not on the menu board, so just ask for it.  By the way, it is just food coloring.  I added lavender to it just for some flavor.  Overall, the latte was nothing special.  The lavender lacking, but the picture of the latter is beautiful.  The only issue I had was the latte was warm, not hot.  Not looking for super hot, but just warm was not my preference.  If you don't want the usually big chain coffee shop, come here and give it a try."
"Got off work and really craving for a korean/hawaiian bbq. Came across this on yelp so i went to have an early dinner since its the nearest kbbq from work. Went in, it was quite busy. an old lady greeted me while she was cleaning tables. But she didnt really say if I should just get a table myself or wait for someone to have me seated. After about 2mins of standing there, i finally came up to her while she was still cleaning a table and ask, she was like ""for here to go?"" I said for here and she said, oh ok please have a seat (while pointing on a table for 4 on the corner). Sat down and a young lady came up, gave me the menu, and ask what I wanna drink. Her smile was very welcoming so I forgot about the earlier incident. A minute later an old man came up and brought my water, convincing me to try their iced tea instead. But no thank you, im good with iced water. He was very friendly and the whole time i was there, he kept checking on me, but never refilled my water. As for food, food is ok. A little pricey. I ate by myself but i felt like I paid for two. I had the combo which has kalbi, meat jun, and chicken that comes with white rice and mac.. Banchan doesnt have my fish cakes! Huhu. Banchan only consists of kimchi, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. I was so sad. I want my fish cake and tofu! lol. I didnt finish all the meat jun and chicken so i asked for a to go box. The old man came back with a to go box full of rice and he said ""for your dinner"" how nice of him! I wanna give this place 4 stars at least, but the food is too pricey, ive had kbbq on same average of taste and quality or better. Just a couple more bucks, i could have had an all u can eat kbbq."
i don t feel mega rushed
"Ah. Holts. I bought my all time favorite tie here. A beautiful black and gold Versace tie (http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/photo/v6GeLkZRfCh-dVk685XTiA/l) that I've never seen sold anywhere else since and I've never seen a tie as black and goldy and beautiful. Beyond that rare find, I've never found a tie at Holts I've really liked. Everything is very ""office."" I dunno.  I've bought underwear here. I need those boxer-briefs for running. That upper, inner part of my thigh rubs against the upper inner part of the matching thigh and sleeping that night is pretty red and painful. I need some kind of lining. I was tired of the Zellers stuff wearing out after a couple months and tried the $50 a pair stuff. Pro-tip: don't try to buy Hugo Boss boxer briefs and Burberry boxer briefs in the days running up to the Gay Pride Parade. You can't find the stuff. But I discovered the Hugo and Burberry boxer-briefs thin and tear just as rapidly as the cheap stuff. Now all my boxer-brief needs are served by Joe Fresh. Sorry, ladies.  They have an awesome sweet vanilla tea that goes on sale before Christmas and makes a good gift for sister in laws and father's new wives.  Their nicer Gucci scarfs sell out quickly before winter really starts."
"I wanted to love this place, but it's twice the price of the cheap $35 mani/pedi you can  have everywhere else and the manicure chipped within 24 hours, my previous manicure for $10 lasted a full week.  They only have a tiny selection of colours.  Service was nice, but ultimately the proof is in the pudding and I can't justify paying double the amount for a less durable job."
"First of all, they start charging cover charge hours before any other bar, even if you are going inside to spend $100 on a steak dinner. The older lady at the entrance is rude and forgetful. Scott the bartender is the best thing about the place. The band is usually the Herndon brothers and when they are singing country are flipping awesome, but then they have dreaded bouts of Kenny Loggins and other non-country songs that make me want my cover charge back. The band stops playing around what seems like 11:30 on weekend nights which is a ripoff. There used to be a DJ between band sets, but now it's a jukebox so we can no longer request our favorite line dances."

"Have been wanting to try this place out for awhile now and finally did on a Friday night! Loved the atmosphere, the music, modern feel and patio seating option. Nice place to hang out, pop in with friends and enjoy a drink/food. Looks like they randomly have some events going on as well that I'd be interested in doing. My boyfriend and I got the beef & cheese empanada (fan of the cheese!) and the steak & cheese flatbread (unfortunately not a fan at all). They have a variety of food items that I can't wait to go back and try out!"

"This was the only part of the expressway in Las Vegas where I could say that you never encounter any traffic, but I will not be able to say that much longer. Once the Shoppes at Summerlin open up it is going to be a mess over here. If you live in West Park say hello to Shopping Center traffic all day long. The holiday shopping season and the weekends are going to be a nightmare."

"I came here during soft opening and was happy about the 10% off and free ice cream. The place definitely is very downtown restaurant brunch vibes given the decor. I love the gold, white and blue theme. However, I waited 45+ minutes to be seated and honestly, I feel like the way they've made the seating isn't using the space very well. We tried the slow cooked short rib donburi. I thought it was good combination of flavours but honestly, $19 is not worth it. The cold brewed teas were presented very nicely in the glass bottle and there was a variety of options. I tried the lychee calpis soda drink and thought that was pretty good too. Service on the other hand was just okay and not sure why but the waitresses seemed a bit confused when taking orders. As for the free ice-cream, it was delicious and my favourite part of my visit as it was a nice milk tea flavour which I love! Nonetheless, I don't think I will be coming here again since it was pricey and just a one time experience for me."
"Pros: Good location, clean, good sound system and private rooms, they allow snacks in the room and don't micromanage things Cons: We were charged $349 for four hours (should have cost $240), when I called to ask about the overcharge I was given the run around, they ran out of some drinks, hot as hell inside the room, the drinks are quite expensive, half the songs were in Asian languages (only a con for English/ French speakers) ."

"I recently ordered a cake from Jenn's Sugarlicious Bakery and overall, it was a pretty good experience.  I appreciated that the bakery's website listed all of their flavors, cake sizes, and pricing options so when I went to order my cake I knew what I wanted.  I was slightly disappointed when the young lady taking my order informed me that if you want any fondant or gum paste pieces on your cake, you have to place your order at least 2 weeks in advance.  I just wanted one flower on the cake...I think they could have bent the rules for me, but no meant no.  The cake itself was decorated exactly how I had asked.  The overall taste was good, but it had about an inch too much icing.  I also thought that there wasn't enough raspberry filling between the cake layers.  I will definitely give Jenn's another shot and next time I'll be more specific about what I want!"

"nice clean place had no issues ordering and took maybe 10 mins or so for the food. ordered chicken and broccoli,  and crab rangoons. wasnt very impressed.. the chicken is very slimy feeling giving me the idea its not cooked properly and has no taste, the broccoli and rice was good. the crab rangoons of course made with immitation crab and cream cheese, normally i enjoy them elsewhere. being my first time at panda i figured they would be ok, they were way too sweet like sugar was added and felt more like a dessert-like icing instead of cream cheese..eh. coulda been worse but felt like a waste of money."

"The guys who work here are really great with their customers. My takeout took 10 minutes longer than estimated, and they gave me egg rolls while they caught up, and then sent me home with more egg rolls.  I LOVE their hand rolls. The fish is perfectly seasoned and I believe they blend tempura bits in giving it a lovely crunch. Their fish to rice ratio is so generous, too. I'm not a big fan of California rolls, but their version as a hand roll is beautiful and eye catching.  I found their rice in the sushi rolls to be a little bit harder than I'd like it, the edges were quite crisp compared to my usual sushi place. Then again, I'm picky and would still order here again.  One flaw, I really disliked the tempura vegetables and shrimp. This is always my go to appetizer and this place really failed it. I don't like their choice of batter as it's a bit thin and hard, and the tempura sauce that comes with it is sweet, which is just... wrong. The vegetables that come with it is a bit odd, like two string beans.  The indoors are beautiful with unique seating, and would be a lovely place to eat in. The tables did smell a little strange however.  I hold this location to the same standards as I would a place in Toronto, so while I did like this place I have too many criticisms to give more than 3 stars. While I won't be ordering the tempura again, I will order a hand roll any day as they've almost perfected it. So good!"

I had been here for a few times during off peak hours so never have much issue with slow service. Drinks I ordered were OK as I usually order their popular ones that the staff had made hundred times or more already.  I kind of like how it has Bake Code on site as I can grab a treat to go with my drinks.  Parking never a issue as there always plenty of parking during off hours. Commerce Gate location always been more a challenge for me.

"This place was all right.  The food was cooked right in front of me and the value was amazing,  $6.00 for Green Curry on rice with a bowl of soup. Can't get any better than that. I was happy with the amount of spice in the Green Curry. Definitely would eat here again. Unfortunately, I'm rarely in the mood for curry. Still something to look out for in the future. Awesome Sauce."

"Petit resto situΓ© juste en face de chez moi; j'Γ©tais avec un ami et on avait envie de pΓΆte, Γ§a semblait Γtre le bon moment pour essayer le Sandhu. Pour commencer, les plats sont plus abordables que ce que l'on pensait (Γ§a commence Γ  11$ pour une Γ©norme portion!), avec un menu de restaurant italien classique, sauf pour ce qui est de la partie ""indienne"" du menu, Γ§a j'ai toujours pas compris. On s'est partagΓ© des pennes sauce rosΓ©e et une pizza aux saucisses italiennes, les plats Γ©taient trΓ¨s bons mais rien d'exceptionnel qui me ferait choisir ce resto au lieu d'un autre. La serveuse Γ©tait gentille mais n'avait pas l'air d'avoir trop d'expΓ©rience; on nous a demandΓ© 2 fois durant le souper si on avait terminΓ© nos assiettes, alors qu'on ne faisait que prendre notre temps et jaser entre nos bouchΓ©es (!), et elle a renversΓ© du vin sur notre table(!!). Aussi, dans la toilettes des filles, il y a une porte coulissante qui mΓ¨ne Γ  la cuisine (j'ai pas plus d'explications, mais Γ§a m'a troublΓ© haha!). L'espace de salle Γ  manger est joli, belle petite ambiance. J'y retournerais si j'avais une fringale de pΓΆtes ou de pizzas mais que je suis trop paresseuse pour marcher jusqu'Γ  un des nombreux autres restos italiens Γ©tablis 2 minutes plus loin sur Mont-Royal."

"The experience is less satisfying than it used to be.  I remember when I first came here the slices were huge and cheap.  The price has crept up about 20%, and the slice has shrunk about 20%, not good.  Service is still friendly, and the overall cool factor is very much still in place, but it's less wow than it used to be."
The food was not bad but not outstanding either. Two whole chicken costed us $175 and it's totally not worth the price that I've paid. I will definitely not going back for their overpriced foods.
i have to admit one of the things that keeps me single is the horror i feel at the vicious pounce of the green eyed demon in myself
i feel dignified especially in mass or at a professional meeting
"The service was friendly and welcoming. I liked the atmosophere there compared to the one at the Galleria. The light roast coffee is good and perfect for me since it's not too strong or bitter. It's rare for me to find coffee like that. However, I just found the food, including the pastries, just OK. I'm sure I'll be back for the coffee."

"It's open 24/7!  They have donuts with cereals!  I was like ""who wants to eat a donuts with cereal like fruit  loops!""  My kid said ""I want that one!""  Never underestimate anything.  I gave it a 3 stars bc it's very sweet the toppings.  It's over glazed and it's falling apart when I ate the donut."
"A new place by Wal Mart that just opened up, very clean and polite service. However despite being a new place their soda machine was broken, or perhaps they just haven't gotten it operational yet? Either way it's a rip off for the canned sodas they make you buy instead. Also the meat served here is mostly just fat tissue, not really any actually meat. Pretty good pricing and overall a nice junk food run if you're in a hurry."

"This Menchie's location is pretty great since it provides an awesome alternative to the usual suspects. Though, I wish I had more options for the actual frozen yogurt it should be noted that I am a capitalist pig and no amount of choice is ever kosher.   Even on a chilly autumn day menchie's is bustling and that makes the experience even better. Service is always great, though it better be for the price they demand.  My typical order:  - Red Velvet or Cake Batter - Oreo Cookie Crumble - Carob Chips - Chocolate Chips - Apple - Blueberry  I'm not a fan of the bobas since they taste pretty synthetic, though the flavouring is pretty dead-on. Like it!"
ive no doubt shed feel threatened and anxious if that changed in a big way
"Great place for sushi but to tell you the truth they really rob you on it. The Fried Scallop roll is pretty big, but the probably on use 2 scallops and it was $20. I know it's upscale and all, but I've had better."

"I went with a group on a Monday night at 7 pm. The place was pretty busy considering it was a weekday. The staffs were friendly and filled our glasses with water quite often but there was no ice in the water... I started with the cold seafood section and had the shrimp, muscles and baby octopus. The shrimp's texture was off and the smell wasn't quite right. It tasted ok with the overly thick seafood sauce so I ate it anyway. The muscles were good. I tried the baby octopus but i think it was raw so it wasn't edible after the first one. I then went on to the hot section. They had a good selection but a lot of the meat looked old or like it was sitting under the heat lamp all day or maybe even leftovers from another day... The food from the grill was really good and seemed fresh. The fruits (strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon, grapes, pineapple) were all perfectly ripe and the desserts were delicious!"
i have finally signed a petition that made me feel kind of hopeful
i wonder if i need to pull back more and create some space for myself sometimes i feel like a heartless bitch for leaving her
"My gf and I decided to come here after Eastgate Mall, since it's along the way. For those planning on going to Ellen's Place, it's by the intersection of Tomken & Kamato. Even when we used the GPS, it led us to another destination. Luckily, we've been there before, but with our families being the ones that drove, we had a sense of remembering our surroundings. We went on Matheson instead and eventually found our destination. Don't be fooled: It's tucked in a ""business""-like plaza. I'm stating this, so whoever's reading this, doesn't get lost like we did.  With being Filipino-Canadian, I'm familiar with the type of food they serve here. We've been here only a couple times with our families. My aunt knows the owners of this restaurant, for she went to school with Ellen. So, needless to say, we got great service and great food every time. But this is the first time we've been here without our families and sadly, it's the exact opposite. We solely came here for the pork sisig. Quite honestly, I've only tried sisig from here and LaMesa (But theirs isn't traditional sisig, it's their own version of sisig with a twist). So I can't compare it with any other place, but regardless, their sisig is top notch. Comes to you on a sizzling pan, which you can hear from a mile away. Keep in mind that despite the sisig being on the appetizer menu, it's pretty big. We only got that and an order of garlic fried rice. We took it home, because we couldn't finish it.  We went there at 5pm on a Saturday. Which is quite possibly their busiest night of the week. Because they have a band performing and have karaoke as well. If I'm not mistaken, they have karaoke every night at 9pm. We were the first ones to get there. Waitress gave drinks and took our order right away. Shortly after she took our order, more people started filling up tables. There were a couple 4 top tables and 2 big groups of people that came in within an hour timeframe. As people have stated, Filipino food takes awhile to make, so patience is key. Which my gf and I have a lot of. But they tested it that night. We got our food, ate and enjoyed it. We both work in Food Service and know how busy it can be. But how their service is managed is poor. From 5pm-7pm there was only ONE waitress serving all the aforementioned tables. I was watching her and she was cool & calm. But she had no help from the owners, whatsoever. I only saw the two owners when they went to talk to the guests. Only once has one of the owner's lifted a dish to serve to a table. Ridiculous. We don't know what was happening in the kitchen. Maybe they were short staff. Who knows. We started to get impatient, because we were waiting an hour just for someone to clear our plates and give us dessert (We ordered the Halo Halo). At 7pm, two more waitresses showed up and started serving the big groups first, rather than the tables of 4 that came in before them. The waitresses cleared all of the dishes from the big groups, before clearing everyone else's. Maybe they do this, because they're in a big group and expect a big tip. At this point, we've decided to cancel the Halo Halo order and go to Bubble Republic for bubble tea instead. Because we didn't want to wait any longer. But shortly thereafter, she comes along with the Halo Halo and apologizes for the wait. We quickly ask for takeout containers for our food and the bill. Luckily, we had cash on us, so we didn't have to wait for anyone. But what baffles me, is I'm looking through the bill and they charge for gratuity! For 2 people! It's ridiculous, especially when the service was lacking attention. With my restaurant-going experience, I only know restaurants charge for gratuity when it's a large party. There were only 2 of us. We dropped the cash and walked out. The food was great, but the service needs working on. Our waitress did her best and was apologetic, but they need more help and a tad bit of common sense with who to serve first.  I'll definitely be coming back, but going to call ahead and order takeout. No way am I making the same mistake."

"Great night out with friends, designated driver assigned and everyone wants the party to continue. A friend recommended CR based on a coworkers visit so why not they have cocktails.  It was still pretty early apparently maybe 3pm so it wasn't super busy but maybe a table of people. The bartender appeared to be a tad lazy, was constantly on his phone and asked if we could return our glasses to the bar when done. I already felt a bit turned off and I just ordered my drink. We decided to order drinks off their men, I mean they have artisan drinks why the heck not a few herbs can only enhance the experience. Our drinks were very weak and couldn't taste the liquor period. We asked for it to be remade and came out in my mind worse. Ended up just drinking a beer and the experience was the same with the other 7 friends.   The bartender also talked a lot about cars when I went to return my glass and order another beer. He didn't leave his spot once but the guy was nice lol.  Overall, maybe it was just the bartender or a newbie since it was a Saturday around 3pm so not the busy time. We'll CR another try bc we've heard good things about the joint so update review to follow after next visit."
"The food is just ok. The burgers are really salty & greasy. Other than the salt, there is no flavor. The fries are salty too. On the plus side, the service is good. The employees walk by & ask you how is everything."

"I know this place gets a ton of hype from midwesterners but not sure i get it. My food was good and we got it fast, but it's not a destination restaurant for me. I ordered the cheeseburger, it was good. My husband got the Italian Beef and Cheddar, he didn't like it. It is a great place for kids. We took two toddlers and were able to get in and out quickly plus it's loud so their screaming didn't seem to disturb anyone. Next time we're in the area we'll probably try it again just for that fact alone."

"Really, this is closer to a 3.5  I've heard lots and lots about Blowfish so I had to come.  Before Blowfish, the only sushi I've had is at AYCE places and here and there at a random Japanese/Fusion Restaurant, so it was definitely an experience for me.   Must add that the table we sat on is the one featured on the menu on the website. Kinda cool.    I was a tad bit drunk, but I remember everything clearly.  The service was fantastic. I must add that. The decor was over the top. I kinda felt like..white people overdoing the japanese thing.   And that basically sums up the whole experience.  While the food was really good, it just didn't live up to what I expected.  Let's talk food.  We had:  1. The Spicy Salmon maki - Basically my favourite item. It was the best spicy salmon I've ever had. The green onions really popped, and the flavours were extremely well balanced here.  2. The Rock Shrimp maki : It was devoured by my friends and I, it was delicious but too over the top. The roll comes with the deep fried shrimp on top, which I felt took away from the rest of the roll. Honestly don't even know what was in the rest.   3. The Red Curry Salmon : Again, I thought the sauce was way too overpowering. I couldn't even make out the salmon in this one.  4. Coconut Bay : I wasn't wowed by it.   5. The Wagyu Beef Gyoza was mad delicious. MAD DELICOUS.  6. The Albacore Tuna was really good. It had a delicous garlic chip that really made the roll.  7. The Chili Berries Saketini was awesome. A little too sweet for my tastes, and I was hoping it would be a touch spicier, but delicious none the less.   All in all it was a great experience. I would defo go back, but it was about 60 a person."
ill add i havent tried all that time but i do feel as i adapt and pick up techniques quickly this is one of the things im amazed that its taken me this long
"I have seen the sign for this place several times as I  frequently go to ""Starbucks"" for coffee. I was down at the ""Care Now Clinic"" today and was a little hungry afterwards so decided to try the place.  I ordered a ""Garlic Steak Wrap"", the woman that rang me up was pleasant and somewhat helpful. She told me that the wrap came with greens inside and a side salad. I chose ranch for my dressing for my salad, (not that great or fresh!)  I got the order to go, (as I live in Boulder City) as there are no healthy options in town. When I got home I was a little disappointed in the meal. For one, the greens are not really fresh and some were brown on the edges and others were just soggy and rotting. Really unpleasant, considering how much I spent on the meal, $14.30 that including a Bai iced peach tea!  Not sure if I'll be back, unless they decide to do something about what they call fresh!"

"I'm updating my review because I since got an estimate for a new system from Honest Air Care. Now, the quote for the new unit itself seemed reasonable, except that their warranty did not include a warranty on labor, which should be included on a $9,000 job unless there are specific extenuating circumstances that would preclude it. While Honest Air Care seems highly competent in terms of their knowledge and technical skill, at the labor rates that they quoted, if I were to require a repair under warranty (which does happen relatively often), the labor would not be included and could be quite costly. So far, what I see many HVAC companies doing - not just Honest Air - is charging extremely high rates for labor. For example, $150 to replace a 20 foot section of thermostat wire that is very easy to access? Come on! 5-strand thermostat wire costs 50 cents/foot at Home Depot and this install would take a maximum of 30 minutes if 1 person has to climb up and down to attach the wire from the thermostat to the AC unit! There wasn't even drywall that it would need to be ""fished"" through. So, giving the benefit of the doubt, that means a $300/hour labor rate? I realize that these companies have overhead, such as insurance, licensing, employee salaries and benefits, office space, vehicles, etc., so I understand that they have to charge enough to cover all that and still make a decent profit, but I still do not see how that can justify such high labor prices. There is definitely a niche open in HVAC for a company that does not overcharge for labor."

3.5  Okay finally found time to grab a cone after seeing so many reviews I like how they change flavors every so often to keep people coming for more.  This time there was vita melon and ramune (Japanese  soda pop) the vita melon tasted pretty good better than the ramune I thought.  A little pricey I thought for an icecream cone but it was worth a try.
We've been here twice in the last month and it's not the cleanest hospital. Lights that need replacing and used tissues under the bed in pediatrics. The staff isn't super accommodating either. They couldn't really help and I got the feeling of insecurity . Next time we'll go elsewhere.
i feel uncertain about a lot of things
"Visit to this place reminded me of  lyrics from Radiohead song - ""No alarms and no surprises""...generous portions, attentive service, awesome location and great patio... I didn't hate my calamari and when I asked my date about his cheeseburger, he said: ""How many stars would I give? Well, 4 out of 5 for sure.But only because McDonalds' one gets 5 out of 5.""  And I agree that it my be a little bit overpriced but as long as shopping and dating central Crocker  Park will thrive, so will this place."
"I've been waiting for this place to open, since it's so close to the house. I drove by our the other night to see some people in the bar and got excited to know that it was finally open.   My friend and I went there yesterday for some food. Starting with the service, it was good. Our water cups were always filled, and they checked in on us a lot. Although, at some points it was a bit incessant. But, if rather have over the top service than no service at all. Plus, we were the only table there for awhile. Our server, Deena, made things a bit awkward. There was just a lot of awkward silences, and it always seemed like she was whispering, but I can look past that.   As far as the food goes, it felt like there were more appetizers to choose from then there were entrees. Which, probably is a good thing because the appetizers we got were far better than the entrees.   We started with the Portobello fries and the crispy gnocchi. The fries were thick slices of Portobello that were lightly breaded then fried. They.served it with ranch, and some other sauce that I'm falling to remember. The crispy gnocchi had Italian sausage, pesto, peas, and walnuts. While it was good, unless you get a piece of sausage in every bite, the dish lacks a bit of salt.   For entrees, we offered the turkey and cranberry sandwich as well as the jambalaya. I don't know what o was expecting out of the turkey and cranberry sandwich, but I was just expecting more. While the cranberry sauce was good, they added quite a bit, so it overpowered everything else. Their version was a little more spruced up, with spinach and brie cheese. However, the cheese wasn't spread at all, just one slice in the middle. So, I only got one or two really good bites out of the sandwich. As far as the jambalaya, it was decent. Had good flavor, but just needed more. It war very mild tasting. Chicken was conned ti perfection though, so moist ! No sausage in the jambalaya thigh. :(   All in all, would I go back ? Probably. It's the closest place to eat next to my house. I'll probably stick with just ordering more appetizers next time though."

"Smaller than Jones market with just as much variety, if not more! Max Market is likely to be my new ethnic shop of choice for Russian goodies. Their prices on most items are also lower, which is awesome.  Store contains a deli towards the back with meats, cheeses, and premade items (they also brew fresh coffee), a small produce section, lots of breads and sweets that are both imported and locally-made, bulk-purchase nuts section, canned and jarred goodies from eastern Europe, and tons of beverages- liquor and alcohol is behind the register and on display.  You can get a ton of goodies here for $20- but my favorite purchase are the cheese burekas, packed 2/$2, and stuffed with feta cheese. They're phenomenal, and the best I've found in this city- I believe they're made in-house, too."
"First,  I am a fan of Second Cup.  But I'm glad this is not the first Second Cup I went to,  else I won't think so flavorably of this chain.  While the place is not exactly small,  the tables and chairs are not as inviting nor as comfortable as other locations.  Worse is the restroom.  Dimly lit,  it just doesn't feel very clean even if it may be.  I even feel that the coffee isn't as good,  though that may just be a halo effect."

"i heard about all the hype for this place and ngl, it looks better than it tastes. it's definitely not bad, the waffles are better than a lot of other places but really??? $3-5 for the waffle plus another extra $3-5 for the ice cream??? it's obviously overpriced because of all the hype and ppl will still get it. the ice cream (soft serve) isn't bad but isn't anything special and their matcha/green tea doesn't really have the flavour. i also got the twist soft serve with my waffles and i thought it would be vanilla and chocolate but it was vanilla with matcha (i think?) instead and i didn't know and again, very little flavour so i'm still not rlly sure what the twist flavours are.  overall, i would still buy it once in a while and i like it, i do, but it's pretty overpriced and i do think they need to plan the expanding of their business (long waits, bad service)"

"Came across this place by accident. Prices are really reasonable and the food is pretty good. I had the Blackened Baja Barramundi and my friend had the prime rib BBQ burger. The fish was nothing special but the zucchini and rice pilaf were good. Overall could have been warmer. The burger had really good flavor.  We came at 5:30 pm (soon after arriving in Vegas). There were only two other people eating, so I would expect the food to be fresher and hotter."

I had pretty good seats about 3 rows back in the center area. The seats are very small. I felt they are smaller than most venues. I saw larger people literally spilling over seats and the guy next to me was practically on top of me. The sounds was way too loud and my ears hurt after. I would suggest bring ear plugs. The show was average. The other reviews on site were on point. It was kinda cheesy and seemed to be pointed at kids or  family. The dancers were good but I wanted more. It was like I was waiting for the big wow. They did pretty good about interacting with the crowd. I would pay around 45 for the tickets but not much more.

i feel as though i have a blank canvas and can pick any theme i want
"This review is for the dim sum only.  I came for dim sum last weekend with a big group.  We ordered about 2 orders of dim sum per person plus a stir fried rice.  All the dishes were tasty; the quality definitely beat the flat price dim sum places.  The dim sum, though not exquisite, were damn good, and they were reasonably priced starting at $2.7 for small (forgot the prices of the other sizes).  The portion of the stri fried rice was good, even if it was at lunch price.  Overall, a solid 3 stars."
i guess i m happy that the world was spared and my family and loved ones are safe but i can t help but feel a bitter disappointment
i feel very reluctant to talk about but also one that i think about a lot and that impacts my life greatly at this point
There are only two places I go for fast food... here is one of them. For around $8 bucks you can get a fish taco and enchilada that are really good and complimented by your choice of beans(blk or cajun) and rice(white or brown) and a tiny salad.Get a side of Mr. Lee's hot sauce for a $1 and heat it all up! Tried the wet baja lada tacos and they were a little to wet for my liking. Stick with the fish and it hits the spot at a very decent price.
i always feel a little weird writing about a guy ive dated because i dont want to do them an injustice or have them come across in a negative way
i was an outsider and i never felt part as i was new that made me feel disheartened
i even snapped a photo to remember that feeling of loving the fact that i was in the right place at the right moment
i just get so attached to the guy im dating usually though its not this bad but iv been so emotional this last year that i just feel greedy and selfish for wanting him here at this very moment
"Graben 2 drinks here in this hot afternoon. Thai iced tea and passion fruit lychee soda. I don't like Thai tea, maybe too sweet for me. But it's a lovely place to relax. Love their bag hanger, very sweet"
i just feel a weird vibe
i feel like beloved and i have something so rare
i feel greedy because i went on that trip and got so much out of it but i dont think the children got anything out of it
i dream i feel like i am finally not burdened by all of the things that i feel just crushing me when im awake
"Went to the Scottsdale P.F.Chang's  The waitress suggested the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli.  I love veggies so order her suggestion.  The brown rice came in a small dish and was very dry and I hardly had enough to mix with the entree; plus there was no room on the plate to stir the meal.  The broccoli surrounded the chicken on the plate.  The broccoli was steamed and now getting cold since it was not mixed with sauce and chicken.  Mixing it with the sauce would have added flavor too.  As I ate the broccoli, I noticed the sauce was under the chicken only.  I asked the waitress why wasn't the dish all stir fried together.  The sauce would have helped keep the broccoli warm and flavorful.   She suggested next time I am in for a meal, tell them and they will stir fry that dish.  Isn't this an Asian type restaurant?  She did not offer to have the chef stir fry the remaining meal.  I had only eaten a little of the broccoli.  Humm..  Not  very smart.  I probably won't be back."
i often feel lonely
"Stopped by for a beer yesterday and it was a relaxing atmosphere. A little smoky but I'm not an asshole that would complain about smoke in a bar. What else would you expect in a bar or casino? Also, I am educated enough to spell the words because and ventilation correctly"
i feel it all grumpy
i see myself starting to feel the emotional dependence on my parents i stop and breathe
i don t know if i would enjoy those books now but i still remember feeling enthralled with those characters and with the amish lifestyle presented
i feel drained at least now i have something to look forward to
ill hopefully feel less inhibited in terms of what i want to say
"A bucket of crab partnered with corn on the cob results in a pretty happy self. Nothing outstanding, but everything you'd expect from a seafood chain. They even start the disco lights and do a little dance randomly during the meal. Left satisfied without hurting my wallet."

i often feel scared nowadays about the result of a big project that im going to do this year
"Blanco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants; my girlfriend and I go nearly every other week for drinks and some food after work. The food here is great! An awesome high-end Mexican taco spot! The elote is delicious as well as the drinks! If you are looking for a fun hip taco spot and don't mind paying a little more this is the spot to go, typically 5 stars from me! I love all the Fox restaurants but this day might have changed my opinion of Blanco. On October 17,2017 we went to Blanco and the whole restaurant had changed it's design. The menu had been updated and when we ordered our typical favorites, they tasted noticeably different and were not up to our expectations. Also on this particular visit, the food had cooled down by the time it reached our table, which made it even less enjoyable.  Every time we go to Blanco I usually order the carne asada burrito. My girlfriend usually orders three street tacos, carnitas, bbq pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She substituted the typical rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beans and rice to go along with my burrito. Generally, we love the food. However, we've recently noticed some inconsistencies. As I previously stated, the menu was recently updated at the Scottsdale location and the food seemed inferior to the norm. Also, we stopped by while we were on a trip to Tucson and each received substantially undercooked carne asada, which left us dissatisfied and without appetites. Although the service is usually friendly and accommodating, as with most Fox Concept Restaurants I've tried, this time around they were not as willing to help. When we pointed out the undercooked carne asada, the server brushed it off and did not offer for our meals to be recooked.  The atmosphere is one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant. I love to go during the NBA playoffs because the crowd around the restaurant is really excited and you can feel the energy in the room.  The food is great; everyone is having a great time and the service is prompt and friendly, what more can you asked for. Each location of Blanco's is uniquely decorated, but all have a laid back beach vibe. All locations have indoor and outdoor seating that is accompanied by lively, colorful dΓ©cor. Of the locations I've been to, the restaurant seems to typically be focused around the bar and the kitchen is within view of customers which also contributes to the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant.   The food at Blanco is priced fairly with most entrees ranging between 12 - 20 dollars. The drinks are slightly more expensive with most cocktails being about $10 each. I like to go during happy hour when there are some food and drink specials. The sangria is a must, and on happy hour a carafe which can get you about 4 glasses is only $18 which ends up being only $4.50 per glass. Overall, I would recommend Blanco! Although we have had a couple less than ideal visits, the restaurant usually has great food, good prices, and friendly service."

"I had a pretty debilitating bout of stomach flu last week, and this was the first day I could finally eat something other than applesauce, chicken noodle soup, and congee. I figured why not celebrate by trying out this new eatery?  I got here on opening day maybe an hour after they officially opened. It looked like half the Asian population in the Phoenix area was eating here lol. The menu is pretty succinct but all the items on it looked delicious. There was a really long lag in ordering since there seemed to be a little confusion with some existing orders. When it was my turn to order I went with the #5 jajangmyeon. I actually wanted to get it to go but apparently they don't offer that here (Boo). Although I had to wait a long time to actually order the jajangmyeon was made in a few short minutes. It looked so tempting and was a big portion. We grabbed some chopsticks, etc. from the side counter (It also had forks, napkins, and condiments). I took it to one of the tables in the food court area and started digging in!  The noodles were plentiful and cooked a touch beyond ""al dente"". The sauce was smooth but the flavor wasn't as bold as other jajangmyeon I've had in the past. It was too oily for my tastes and I would have liked more cucumber(?) than the small tiny mound on top. I was also disappointed to find that 90% of the sauce had only onion and cabbage in it, with some small scraps of meat.  I didn't see any options for beverages here (Other than a water cooler in the corner) which I thought was odd but I suppose you could just buy a beverage from Tous Les Jours next door.  Although I didn't totally enjoy the jajangmyeon, some other items on the menu looked really enticing, especially the tangsuyuk so I will be back to try more!"

"I'm really torn about this place. Their food is a bit tastier than Sichuan Gourmet up the road (which was already pretty good), and they give better portions. For a while it was my go-to place for Sichuanese takeout. However, after a few disastrous take-out experiences I think I'm giving up.  A couple of weeks ago I placed my traditional order of Shredded Pork and Dry-fried Green Beans over the phone. They confirmed the price and time. However, when I picked up my order, they had substituted the Chinese menu shredded pork for the more expensive Americanized version. It was not good at all. However, I ordered by phone and can't really blame them for misunderstanding or ""misunderstanding"" an item with a similar name.  I decided to place orders on their website instead to remove any problems. For two orders this went great. It was ready for pickup on my way home from work, and the food was great. However, my most recent order was a disaster. When I got there to pick it up, the employee at the counter looked at me like I was nuts, insisting that they never got the order. I showed her the email, and she searched her desk. Finally she found the order, never sent to the kitchen, buried under some papers. She offered no apology and just said ""Wait 15 minutes."" Given I had placed the order 45 minutes ago, that wasn't going to happen. I said to cancel the order, and she just nodded and then turned around and started talking to the other employee next to her. That was it, not even a ""sorry."" Mistakes do happen, especially with printed orders. However, their dismissive way of handling it was really unfortunate.  I might go back to eat inside sometime soon because I love their food, but unfortunately given their level of service I don't think I can suggest ordering take-out."
"I was treated by one of my clients (found out later she goes there for lunch- I went at dinner time) who loves this Buffet & I did see some Asians eating here:  service was prompt, efficient & sweet. Nice that there was a 10% yelp check-in offer.  I'm normally not a Buffet eater as I my mom would attest to (saying I don't eat enough to make it worthwhile lol) because I generally like my food freshly prepared & piping hot or cold.   The fruit & salad areas were fresh. Some of the hot foods: like broccoli/beef, walnut shrimp, sausage & ribs at hot bar was good.  Udon or Soba noodle soup was made fresh & cooks was kind enough to bring it over to us because we already checked on it once but then forgot when eating. Sushi was so-so. Lots of varieties but mostly average tasting (wasn't bad but wasn't the best I've tasted) food.  Ambience was clean & nice because they integrated the old Claim Jumper decor with Asian influences. I like it when someone UPCYCLES.   Would I go again? Yes for lunch (since it's more reasonable-cheaper) if I'm in area but not for dinner as first choice because for the price though I can eat at W. H. Buffett for less on weekdays for far tastier food."
i be made to feel rotten
"Had dinner here last night. Ordered the #35 and my husband got his usual pork nachos. The food is great! The servings tho are much smaller than the Don Juan restaurant downtown on Main Street. The customers are completely different. They cater more to the white retired/upper class people. Which is okay, it's just different vibe than original location. I'd rather drive the extra mile to downtown restaurant for serving sizes and the diversity of customers. Plus the waiters at summerlin location check on you every 10 minutes, but it feels as if it's every 5. Where as the other location doesn't check on you rarely at all. So that's a thumbs up to summerlin. Restaurant decor in summerlin is decorated to make upper class family feel more comfortable. Main St location is all Frida out and very authentic feel to it."

"I tried this place and got caught up in the hype of the whole fusion thing. After the novelty wears off I realized how good Mexican food and Korean food is just by themselves.  Bring these together is just a good idea on paper. Let's put it this way the place is busy busy but no Mexican and no Korean customers. If you think kimchi is the only thing Korean food has to offer go to a bone fide eatery. It doesn't take a genius to replace ground beef in Mexican dishes with bulgogi and voila...fusion. Shortly they do both cuisines rather mediocre so the combination falls short of any greatness. The only saving grace is they give you a lot of food. If you're smart you'll catch on quick to the ""just add kimchi"" trick to every dish the owners had in mind. They have Mexican food in the back part of the menu as if an afterthought.  Go yelp Thai or Pho restaurants in the area If you have a craving for Asian food.  Want good authentic Mexican cuisine look elsewhere. If you just want to be curious and say you've been here then its your time and money to lose. Synergy has not been achieved. Experiment failed!"
prolonged niggling of friend on a single theme which i considered of no consequence
"Run-of-the-mill Chipotle. This location is nothing special. Very small. The only comment I really have is that I felt like I was being rushed out. I was one of like, 4 customers in the restaurant when I was ordering. But I felt like I was being pushed along as if there was a crowed behind me. I order fast since I get the same thing every time, so the fact that they were going too fast for me speaks volumes.."
"Car Sales: I have purchased 2 cars from VW South, not because of the customer service but because I love VW's and I knew what I wanted. My first VW was purchased from VW South in 2006 at this time the sales rep was very kind, professional, and not pushy. This past year I purchased a 2013 VW Beetle and truthfully I did care for the sales rep at all. Actually my husband and I left the lot because we did not care for him and his sales style and I decided to do my shopping online instad. Once I found what I wanted from their lot I called VW South to verify that they had it in stock and told them that I would be up that afternnon to purchase the car. Thankfully the sales rep that I did not care for was not working that  day and I did not have to interact with him then a week or so later I received a thank you letter from him for purchasing the car. I think this guy got credit for my sale when he did not deserve it but I guess that's how car sales work, the first person that approches you and gets you to give him your name or number ""claims"" the sale??? Service Department: I ordered racing stripes from VW to go across my new 2013 VW beetle. The sales manager that I worked with (I believe his name was Mike) arranged for them to get installed. The instalation was not great, I have some bubbles and riges in the stripe that I did not notice when I first picked the car up. Everytime I take my car to get washed and hand waxed I hear that my stripes were not installed correctly. When I took my VW up to the service department I spoke with the sales manager that sold me the stripes and he told me that an outside company came in to install the stripes for me and I needed to speak with them about the problem. I explained to the sales manager that I purchased the stripes from VW South and I payed VW South for the instal and I would think that VW South would contact the company that put them on for me to take care of the problem. The sales manager then agreed to call the company for me and said he would call me back about it. A year later I still have not heard back from the sales manager about this and my stripes are still not correct. I could follow-up again with them about this but I honestly dont think I will get it resolved. Yesterday we had to take our 2007 Jetta to the service department bc the trunk keeps popping open by itself and this is causing the battery to die. From the start when I spoke with Tracy from service department on the phone I felt as if she was ""in defence mode"" from the begining when I was just trying to explain to her what the problem was. Tracy went on to tell me that they may not be able to figure out the problem is if it does not occur while the car is with them and it is going to cost me $105 per hour that they spend looking. She said we can put a new latch on the trunk or try to replace parts but it can get expensive because they were not sure what it could be. I decided to leave the car with they anyway when we webt back to pick it up and walked back in the service department the lady at the first desk was sleeping at her desk and as we walked up to Tracy's work area several people in her office laughing with their phones out like they were on FB and quickly put their phones away when they saw us walk up. Tracy greeted us and said that they had ""just finished"" with the car and they could not find anything wrong with it. My husband went on to try to explaine to the service guy (David) exactly what was going on with the car. David said he had never heard of this and when my husband started to tell him some info that he found out about the problem on a VW form Tracy cut in and said ""He has been reading those forums"". My husband got upset with Tracy for cutting him off and let her know that he was upset. So as of now we do not know what the problem is and we are out $105. Tracy did offer to let us bring the car back 3 days later so David could work with it again and call VW Tech support but because we now question some of the employees and managements integrity we will probably change different VW dealer for service work."

"Good service but not the best food in the area.  They advertise as a premium restaurant with great service , warm atmosphere and great food.  This is located near the airport and during the week will attract business travellers (mostly men) and can create a warm vibrant environment.  In the bar area (dimly lit) you will found TVs and patrons chatting away.  It is great if you are dining as a group or by yourself.   The wait staff provides good service and do their best to look good and service with a smile.    I think this is all I would visit this moxie location for.  I don't recall having a good meal here.  This trip I ordered their sirloin with lobster and shrimp butter.  When my entree arrived, cold butter on a warm steak is not a good combination.  I almost ask the server to take it back and re-fire the butter but was worry that they over cook the sirloin.  But as a cut into the steak, it wouldn't have matter, the cut was so bad that my jaw got a good work out tonight .   I do have to say the bed of spinach, corn and sausage was nice and was the real hero on the plate.   I would recommend coming for appetizer and drinks but go elsewhere for dinner."

"Great fresh food! Love Vietnamese food and this joint was my first Vietnamese find in Charlotte. Only downside is no lunch menu which left a heftier hole in my pocket. The portions are smaller than I would expect for the price.   Don't take the chopsticks though, even on accident or the owner will run out to the parking lot to get them back."
i provided dinner alcohol and a place to crash and all i got in return was the feeling of being completely unwelcome in my own apartment

"I really wanted to give Pomo 4 stars but just couldn't.  I love the concept of a authentic Naples pizza but I didn't think the pizza was that great. It was good, nothing special except for all the hype on the menu explaining all the ingredients. I'd go back but it didn't blow me away or have me craving to go back like other pizzerias I've been to.   I think they lost me when I ordered the caprese salad and it was served with some of the worst mozzarella I've been given at a restaurant. I couldn't believe an Italian restaurant would allow that. Is the chef not checking the quality of his products daily??  Service and ambiance was good. I would tell you to try it and give it your own opinion."

"DUDE! I have lived in Vegas for almost three years and couldn't find a good east coast pizza until I found Familia Pizzeria. Hellz yeah!  Familia pizza makes a kick ass pepperoni pizza. They cook with a gas oven which makes for a consistent cook. The sauce is delicious and the pepperoni is perfectly sliced.The crust is just like home too! (I'm from the east coast)  I would have given this place five stars, but the staff was a little rude, which honestly, is fine with me because thats what I'm used to from an east coast pizza shop.   If you live in Southwest Vegas, don't go anywhere else but Familia. It's a small shop tucked behind Bohas restaurant. You can dine in or take out. Either way, you'll be pleasantly surprised."

"It looks like a nice enough airport compared to others I've been in.  The shuttle to the rental car area works well, despite the rental cars being offsite the way they are.  Coming in I had no complaints.    Leaving town, I was let down that I had to go to the A gates, and there was nothing good available for food.  I got the renovated area unfortunately.  I was stuck with a kiosk serving overpriced sandwiches.  Eh, that's just life I suppose."

"The Rampart Casino is a-ok. It's mostly a local retirement home (you'll never see as many oxygen tanks and walkers as you will here) and a great place for grandma and grandpa to go and spend their grandkids' inheritance on penny slot machines. It's fun to count the number of walking canes here.   The casino floor is situated in a big circle so it's hard to get lost on the floor. It's spacious but can get very smoky and crowded on busy nights.   They have a good selection of slot machines and games (mostly pennies) and a few table games that cater to the golfers or convention goers staying at the attached hotel.   Join the player's club for free and you'll get monthly mailers with offers in the mail (if you play a little bit, you can expect free slot play coupons and coupons for a free buffet). The Rampart also runs promotions for free trinkets (t-shirts, waffle irons, etc.).   The restaurants are pretty bad, the coffee shop and pub are the only decent options. Stay far away from the Carmel Room and the buffet!"
"Good food for what there was, atmosphere was good and staff were friendly. Could have done with more of a selection of food and more vegetarian stuff."
"The incline itself is a must see in Pittsburgh, but the staff needs to make some changes.  Upon arrival, the woman at the bottom of the Incline was very rude to not only us, but the elderly couple behind us in line.

"I want to really love Gold's because of its accessibility, its affordability, and all around amenities offered. I can practically take any type of class I want--yoga, weight-lifting, cycling, etc--all throughout the day, 7 days a week. There are plenty of machines, even during peak hours, and I guess I get 2 free personal training classes just for enrolling.  Despite this, it is hard to look beyond the lack of attention to functionality of the gym and the demand for the pool. The area to the right of the machines on the main floor has ample space for stretching, core work, and a TRX station...Why are there no mirrors here? Form is a wonderful thing to assess when doing planks. Instead, there are several large windows that serve really only the purpose of letting in the occasional bright light of cars...and the occasional car to check out my rear. Lady Gold's.....why? The room is so small it's uncomfortable with only a few people in it. Its small areas with mirrors and mats can barely serve the needs of two people. The ""main"" weight area is accompanied by so many power lifters and machines that even I, as a former D1 female athlete, find it extremely uncomfortable and intimidating. Make lady gold's and the main weight area one; tackle the stigma head on that women should feel inferior if they can't use these big bulky weights and machines with Hulk Hogan at my side. Don't make us feel more ""comfortable"" in a claustrophobic room.  And finally, the pool...yes the area that triggered this snap. Why do you not have a separate pool for the ""demand"" of aqua class? A previous reviewer also brought this up and it was dismissed and noted that there are plenty of times that the pool is in fact ""open."" Frankly, I I initially thought the guy reviewing could have easily adjusted his schedule to accommodate an hour long class...Well, now that I'm here enrolled and swimming:  you have to consider getting to the gym at 4 am to get your swim in because master's swim is at 545 am to 7 am Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Then it's also offered 1130 am Tuesdays and Thursdays so don't think about always going during lunch. Aqua class is also at 945 on Monday, 430 pm on Tuesday, 9 am on Wednesday,  515 pm on Wednesday, 430 pm Thursday, 9 am Friday, and 8 am Saturday. Now, factor in that everyone takes these classes into account, tries to swim right before or right after. You are almost never guaranteed your own lane. You should consider yourself lucky if you have your own lane or don't have to wait to share a lane. So...why is there no searatw aqua class pool like at Pinnacle if there is so much demand for it? The gym should know plenty of their members enroll to swim the pool. I cant even count the number of times I've swam next to former collegiate swimmers, elite triathletes, and every day people looking to take stress off their joints but remain active. Right now, I'm not really convinced it was a smart move to pick Gold's for the pool over Pinnacle. I'd rather have a higher membership fee than dealing with the stress of trying to get 3 swims in during the week alongside an array of classes for a small group of about 15 people. Overall, I'm looking forward to leaving once the weather is nice enough for an outdoor pool that doesn't disregard swimmers despite its presence of a lap lane pool."

"This lounge is located inside the holiday inn. The food was only so so. I even let the server pick out the best item on the menu. I wasn't impressed especially after she over sold out so well lol. She was very friendly and attentive. Draft blue moon was way over priced, $8, but it is a hotel bar. Burger was ok, but I expected more for $14."
"What I enjoyed the most:  Barbeque chicken pizza on wheat dough - they're perfect together  Other dishes were delicious too but not my favorite: New York Style pizza - needed more mushrooms to balance out the salami, pepperoni, and Italian sausage Grilled shrimp salad - very good salad that accompanied our pizza, will definitely order it again!  What dish they can improve on: Duck tacos - go easy on the sour cream!  Service: We came in a few minutes after happy hour had ended but our waiter was gracious enough to give us our first round happy hour prices!    Why they didn't get four stars: No beers on tap!"

"Honestly I went here because the name: Michael Symon.  It's basically a build your own burger bar.  The meat was disappointing.  Small parties that were formed too tightly.  This made the meat tough and chewy.  The pickle bar was five star.  As were the sauces they offer.  Rosemary fries didn't impress either.  The concept is good and resonates well with me,  the execution of the meals was a let down though."

"I was really pleased with our most recent trip to iHop. The service was a little lackluster in that the server was having a particularly loud conversation with another guest.   Red Velvet Pancakes were really good and left me wanting more. I seriously considered ordering more, but didn't want my company to wait around on me just so I could hog on more cakes."

"After talking to a couple locals who had raved about this place, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try since it was close to where we were staying. It is located on Queen West, across the street from McDonald's. We had taken public transportation to get here, but it didn't look like there were plenty of spaces to park.  Walking in, the restaurant was surprisingly small. As many have said, there is not much seating (less than 10 tables) and seemed very cramped together. You order and pay before finding a seat.  The Vatican ($11.59): 5/5. My boyfriend had chosen the Vatican.The cashier had stated that the burgers were made of the highest quality and only make the burgers to order. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, especially because of the fact that the buns are made out of grilled cheeses (Yes. You read that right.) The burger was packed full of ingredients and the patty was dense. He has a huge appetite and his burger really did the trick.  High Priest ($9.99): 3/5. I had chosen the High Priest. As someone who is from the West Coast of the United States, this reminded me a lot of an Animal Style burger from In 'n' Out. The patty was a bit on the drier side and lacked some seasoning, however the plethora of ingredients compensated for both problems. Though the burger was good, I could not seem to shake off the fact that they were so similar, yet this burger was almost double the price.  Though it was not the best burger I have ever had, I would definitely come again."

"An acceptable little Itali-American place.   I give it four stars rather than five because a lot of their food is clearly not made ""in-house."" If it seems awfully familiar, it is likely it was shipped in from one of the many companies that supplies ready-made entrees. But it has a nice atmosphere and overall the food is satisfying, so I still recommend it for dates or family outings."

"Black Truffle Carbonara Tagliatelle, sitting at the top of the menu at $18.99, had the honour of being my lunch today. Garnished with healthy grating of parmesean, pea shoots, a raw egg and grated black truffle, this sizeable dish certainly looks to be delicious, but was it?  After combining the egg with noodles (which I thought was more fettuccine than tagliatelle), I dug into the quite sizeable portion, whereupon my first bite revealed not a fresh, perfectly al dente pasta, but a formerly dry noodle that spent an extra thirty seconds too long in the bath. Pushing aside my disappointment, I turned my attention to the unmistakable delight of black truffles which single-handedly carries this dish (and also dominates over the other flavours). While containing pancetta, a raw egg and cheese, I found the flavour of the sauce to be single dimensional, with consistency on the looser side. A little more richness to better bind the sauce to the noodles at the beginning, instead of leaving a pool at the end would have been welcome. It isn't to say that this dish wasn't good, but the potential is there to be great.  In terms of service, our party was a large group of nine with five other tables of two in the restaurant. Our dishes came out staggered, with the first diner finishing before the ninth diner received their meal. This was explained to us that there were only two chefs in the kitchen and as a consolation, we were offered a gratuitous drink - a choice of lemonade or blue raspberry lemonade. I chose the latter, but received (what I am sure was) blue koolaid instead. Recommendation: forego this.  In general, the size of each dish is quite large (ravioli notwithstanding), and the value for each is quite high. With that in mind, if you come with the expectation of an average meal at a reasonable cost, you would not leave disappointed. Just don't drink the koolaid."

"Inexpensive.  Clean, simple, small restaurant.  Like that they have Boba!    The pho was 50% off so very inexpensive.  The price of the tofu spring rolls were cheap and you get 3 HUGE ones.  Way better deal then what we buy at Trader Joes.  I did not care for the rice noodle with tofu and vegetable dish on the Vegetarian menu.  First they sent it out with a fish sauce.  I had to send it back.  Next it had a soy sauce.  It was so flavorless and boring.  I took most of it home and then didn't eat it.  I won't hurry back."

"Hula's is set to replicate that of a mod 1960's, tropical bar with old surfer movies playing on the ceiling. The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory. I'm a huge ahi tuna fan; however, the Island Style Poke I wasn't completely impressed with. For vegetarians the Spicy Tofu Tacos were quite tasty but I would venture out to say that if you want a fun atmosphere with tropical style drinks, then this would be the spot. I was disappointed in the wine list but Hula's has a great selection of tropical drinks served in fun glasses. A fun spot for cocktails and their happy hour goes from 4-6 with $5.00 appetizers and signature tropical drinks. I won't say I'll never go in for drinks but the food I could live without."
i feel fantastic jonathon coulton
"This is the sister restaurant to Khao San Road, but I don't think it is nearly as good.  The food is decent, and better then average thai in the city, but I have had a few misses too.  The seating is very casual, with plastic stools at the tables.   I really like the fried rice with an egg on top.  However, I ordered it as take out once and it was not good at all.  The portion was really small and it was super oily. That being said, we went for Song Kran, which is thai new years and it was suuuuuper fun!  They give you water guns to shoot each other and bring out the food in small courses that you eat as you run around.  If you get the opportunity I was recommend going for this.  You have to buy tickets in advance and they sell out fast."

First time it was great. The second time was not. I ordered the rib and pork combo and the meat was really tough and not so meaty. Your better off going to Nevada chicken cafe where the ribs are so good and meaty and their chicken is really good too. I don't know what happened..it must be the cook. I ordered online too and they forgot to make the green beans...i had to wait 10 minutes more for it. The cashier had to remiind the guy in the back twice before putting in a batch. No apology or anything. Won't be coming here again. Nevada chicken won me over with food and good customer service.

"Solid lunch buffet (lunch buffets seem to be a standard of Indian Restaurants).  I even prefer the lunch buffet to the preparation of the A La Carte menu for dinner service - I found the food quality at the lunch buffet to be a bit better strangely enough, and the sauces to be of a better quality in that format.  Definitely try to Gulab Jamun and the Chicken Tikka Masala."

"There is no question that the meat quality here is high and the burgers are tasty. The fries are also good. 2 problems though. One, they are very greasy, so much so that the two burgers I've had here have actually been sitting in a small pool of grease, leading my bun and some fries to become soggy. This could perhaps be mitigated by asking for your burger to be cooked slightly longer, something I will ask for when I go back. Two, I am always disappointed when higher end burger joints opt for processed cheese slices; at least have an option for real cheese! This is a debate between burger lovers that will never be settled, some people prefer processed cheese, but I think there should always be an option if a burger joint wants to be considered a quality shop. It's the same issue I have with Five Guys and Burger Priest..."

"This is a pretty decent bakery.  Food wise, the coffee is good quality. The baked goods, aka cake, buns, and cookies, are all fresh and tasty. Cost wise, it is a little expensive at times, especially for the sealed baked goods. But the buns and coffee are average priced.  All-in-all, if you're hungry, its a good place to grab a bite if you are in a rush. Definietly A-Ok."

"The reviews did not lie, this place has a side alley entrance, but the inside is normal restaurant. The drinks are definitely not what people are coming here for, though a tallboy of ""tiger beer"" is about $6. Staff is friendly, and unassuming, they're kind of there to do the things that need to get done, but don't really stand out all that much.   What really earns this place it's stars is the friend chicken. You get 3 pieces at $2 each during happy hour with the purchase of a drink. It is hot, fresh and delicious. The chicken is lightly coated with spices, while the inside is moist and juicy. It comes with their hot sauce and white mayo based sauce (kind of dill-y), that are both super tasty. This surprisingly did live up the my expectations and I would definitely go back for more friend chicken!"
im just feeling so dazed everyday
"This place seems to have a couple bad reviews here and there. This place was just fine on a Friday afternoon at lunch time (along with a crowd of worker bee's getting their lunches)   Food was tasty, atmosphere was just fine (maybe a tad bit noisy) but overall a place to at least visit a couple times to get a good feel for it. A bit pricey for what you get. (Ordered a club sandwich and my girlfriend got a sandwich along with a pomegranate drink and a coffee iced drink she got) all for just under $30."

"Le Chien Fumant is a quick 3 block stroll from my place and I always looked in longingly wanting to eat there, but was waiting for the right opportunity. The day finally came and I brought a friend for what I was hoping would be a quaint, original, tasty meal but what I got was mediocre at best.  The thing is, I wanted to love Le Chien, but it kinda let me down. I had the gnocci (very average) and the dorΓ© (fairly tasty). They do have a decent number of vegetarian choices but the menu on the night I was there was fairly meat-heavy. I am going to come back and try brunch next time as the menu looks ever so promising.  Come for the cute looking staff, quaint location/decor and the kick-ass cocktails, but don't come in here expecting the best meal in Montreal by any means."

Nice atmosphere in the ever popular Downtown Chandler area. So many places to choose from down here.   We heard it was opening and decided to give it a go for Happy Hour.  My opinion thusfar on this place is they miscalculated their demographic and the income of the area. It is VERY EXPENSIVE.   Its the kind of place you go for $14 drinks. Typically for that i'd be going to N Scottsdale. This is downtown chandler. Median income is say $40k?  Drinks were weak and loaded with Ice. Decided not to try any of the happy hour food menus because none of them sounded appealing to us at the time. For example a bowl of Olives for $9.  We may try it again since we are just south of it 3 miles.

FOOD: I felt like although they were going for the whole tapas type of food vibe, the portions were pretty small for the price. On another note, I do think it's a nice place for a casual date because the food presentation is just beautiful. My favorite are the flat breads! YUM!  SERVICE: No complaints, very friendly and fast!"

"My expectations aren't too high for a juice kiosk at the airport, but I liked the smoothie here better than the one I got at Rachel's Kitchen (further down the terminal, with a higher overall rating).  As others have said, the unfortunate older Asian woman who runs this joint has absolutely no service skills. That said, the smoothies are made to order, a good price for the size, and have various add-ins available at a reasonable cost: superfood and kale each $1. Menu has quite a bit of variety, too."

"I had a lunch meeting at Bambino Bistro today and was pleasantly surprised by the crowd dining both in and outdoors when I arrived.  Though it was not well marked, I did figure out the location based on the address...  We waited what seemed like a really long time to get water and to order... this place is a two man operation.  It was just Chef/Owner/Manager Leonard and one other employee when we were there.  The service was far from attentive but the food was enjoyable once it arrived.  I had the Greek salad.  The others at my table  enjoyed their sandwiches once they figured out which was which.  (They mixed up the two of them and served them backwards).  The fresh bread was a treat and the hummus was an odd texture, but it was tasty.    Would I rush back to Bambino?  Probably not.  And I definitely would not go if I were in a rush.  But if I felt like a Greek salad, a panini sandwich, or fresh bread and was not in any kind of a hurry, I would give it another shot."

"The only buffet option within the Suncoast Hotel.   The dinner is reasonably priced if you're not particularly looking for something.   Saturday night is prime rib and shrimp scampi. Not the greatest but not the worst either.   The other stations are so so.   If you have a comp then this would be four stars. If you had to pay, it's more of a two and a half but the service that you'll receive rounds it up to three stars and I feel that's fair.   The plates are cleared the moment you're finished and the drinks are topped off.   The dining area is comfortable. The seats and booths are well placed.   The only thing that I didn't like we're the extendable dining tables as they were a bit wobbly and silverware kept falling.  The desserts were decent but not many options to choose from.   The ice cream wasn't dryers which I prefer and the consistency wasn't right. It's probably their settings. I still finished it though.   At the end of the day, what it came down to was I came in hungry and left full.   I didn't feel like I had to stuff my face with everything to justify the cost of free and I left happy just in time to catch my free movie at the theater.   I'll probably be back here again.   Thanks!"
i need to feel his tender lips lovingly upon mine cause if i dont sometime soon i just know that i will die
i must confront on a daily basis when there s so little to be connected to and to feel important about
"The concept is neat, and the ice cream looks pretty and yummy. But taste wise I wasn't too impressed. We only got one scoop and that was a mistake, the waffle was super dry without the ice cream. But then, it was super soggy and unappetizing at the bottom. I'm glad I tried it, but I likely won't return."

"We sometimes go here for their lunch buffet on a Friday. It's just a short walk down from the North York Centre subway stop so it's quite convenient to get to.  The lunch buffet is $11.99 and has all the regular dishes that you would normally find in an Indian buffet. The food, for the most part, is really tasty (their Butter Chicken is fantastic) although I can't say that I'm a big fan of their Tandoori Chicken...  I find it to have an overwhelming flavour of charcoal.  This place isn't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out."

"Growing up in Arizona, the Buttes were always known to me as an awesome place to stay, although I never did because, well, I lived there. But as an adult coming back to the valley to visit, this place left me wanting more. Don't get me wrong, the grounds are awesome, the bartenders and staff are great and the breakfast is delicious, but the rooms really need a total revamp. Our room was large, and you could tell they had recently updated them, but an update isn't enough. Our shower knob just turned and turned so it was a guessing game as to when it would turn on or off, as well as what the temp would be, there was a solid inch gap where the faucet had pulled from the wall and someone tried to caulk it, but it was hideous and didn't work, our room still had a hideaway bed in the wall, very creepy!  The decor has got to go. Other than the outdated rooms and the millions of bees swimming next to you in the pools, this was a fun place to stay. They had live bands or Djs on the weekends by the pool, it was very lively, there are a few hidden hot tubs placed high in the mountain sides, overlooking the rest of the pool, and they had many great areas to get an awesome view of the beautiful Arizona sunsets."
i remember feeling frantic at this point
i feel amazed when i saw the final result even thos without fishes inside
"Chinese chicken salad was cold and fresh and huge- chicken would be better if it was chunks and not shredded. Hummus was served with thin and crunchy pita crisps, candied double fried bacon sounds amazing, but it wasn't living up to the hype, vegas mule was decent. This place has a nice interior- clean and modern. The menu features a lot for every mood. Right off the strip."
i came back and for some reason my mind feels blank
i feel that family should be supportive of each other im still on that belief
i tell him i want to feel loved and wanted basically because he never initiates sex or shows any affection he says things like then go find a man who will give you that i cant do it
ive dreamt about and now feel irrationally affectionate towards ricky wilson wolfman dominic masters james blunt i think he was about to go to prison and crying
i feel reassured about the safety of canadas food supply because i think that the cfia will do a good job at taking action and realizing where the issue is coming from and stop the issue
i got home around half past two he d already gone out some family birthday do which i have to say i was relieved to discover because i was feeling anxious about our being at home together
i feel neurotic disappointed in him rejected and humiliated
i admit to feeling more assured knowing if the internal parts are of higher quality than most
i feel accepted for whatever i say
i feel grumpy when i haven t yoga ed in a few days
"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place sooner. This isn't my go to theater, but they often have more convenient showing times so I've been here a few times over the past few months. Everything's been pleasant when I've gone. It helps that I don't usually visit during peak hours, but even then I've never had anything to really complain about. It's just ok."
"Clean, friendly staff and good food.  Giving three stars because I wasn't particularly blown away with the noodle soup broth as it was a little bit oily, and not flavourful like I'm used to. Portion sizes and prices are also smaller, and more expensive compared to your typical mom and pop pho place.  One thing that I really liked about this place was the customizable dishes. So instead of searching through your typical lengthy menu of different soup combinations, their menu actually allows you to choose the types of meats you want.   This is definitely a classier version of a pho place, but with that you lose some of its authenticity.  Good but won't be coming here again unless I'm close by."
i know i would feel on top of the world and eager to encourage other women to do the same
i search for an excuse so that i can move on with light heart without feeling pressured
"It's been awhile since I've written a review, and I've been reminded that I need to get busy or lose my Elite status next year. The problem is that I need to be moved in a positive or negative way to get inspired enough to write a review, and I haven't had a moving dining experience in quite some time!  This place has all the makings of that needle in a haystack restaurant you find when exploring a city. And while I enjoyed the authenticity of Forgotten Taste Pierogies, complete with counter service and carry out only dishes, the food was just good, not great. I don't confess to be a Pierogi expert by any means, but my limited experience with Pierogies in the past painted a much better memory than the Pierogies I had today. They were good enough to eat, but a lot more bland than the ones I've had elsewhere. The stuffed cabbage also has a bland meat filling and was topped with a very basic tomato sauce. The highlight for me was the Haluski, which was an afterthought to me in the combo I ordered. The Haluski had a crunch with the Cabbage & Onions and was topped with a smooth, buttery sauce that combined perfectly with the tender Bowtie pasta.  Overall, I would recommend this place, but next time I come back, I'm going to try their more unique Pierogi of the day and a couple different dishes (like the Goulash!)."
i suppose im feeling slightly apprehensive
i feel inhibited because i can hear their converations and am afraid they can hear mine
i feel as though the concept of lifestyle change rather than weight loss has been beaten to death but it really is something that i believe in and am currently experiencing

i didn t know whether to feel complimented or frightened
Stopped by for burgers. Nothing to complain about. Decent food. Got their North Burger and Greek Burger with two drinks for about $18. I would say 3.5 stars. Definitely not 4 stars though.
i talk to them they often admit that they still don t feel like a successful author
i try not to be too dismissive of elections since i feel privileged to have the right to be dismissive of elections but it s really hard to get too excited about an election where half the races on ballot are folks running completely unopposed

i can have such a negative impact on one person that even though we are now completely apart she can still feel so strongly for in such a hateful way
The good news is we only had to wait 90 minutes this time instead of three hours. Very nice facility very well-maintained. The negative is the organization from a management standpoint seems very disorganized. We had a gift card to use and not only do they not work at the lane terminal but we had to ask 3 separate employees and stand in two separate lines before someone could help us use our gift card to pay. The probably would not of been nearly as frustrating and not just waited 90 minutes.
i like the brush a lot but since returning from spain sob and the release of real techniques i started using the expert face brush for my liquid foundation and the sephora mineral powder brush sat at the back of my collection feeling unloved
i could feel the lord supporting me then helping me walk back up to the temple and through the rest of the time there
"In terms of happy hour prices and quality, this place is top notch. They have a great variety of rolls on the menu, it was actually a bit overwhelming but what was nice is that the menu had details and photos which not all sushi places have. The fish was fresh and the service was good. I would like to come back and try more things."

i find god s presence if i feel scared lonely sad but i feel his presence most when im happy because it is like i m rewarded by god and i feel really thankful
"I wanted to like this show so badly. The concept was genius: Vegas doesn't want to sit through a 3 hour Broadway musical, so let's just take the best of the hits and put it in an hour and a half show...  First of all. It lasted an hour and ten minutes if that. Second, I love broadway. But these shows are so outdated. And of the outdated-ness there are so many classics missing. They performed these blocks of certain musicals like Cabaret and Chicago instead of moving on to other shows.   They could have really put a decent storyline to this. But they didn't. Instead, they had a few narrators that made you feel really disconnected. Some of the narration was by Steve Wynn that made me feel like I was listening to the discovery channel.   Pretty much every song was your the epitome of a Broadway jazzy show tune. I would have loved to see them slow it down a few times without the cheesy smiles and sequins. Don't Cry for Me Argentina, Memory, I Dreamed a Dream, Music of the Night, Defying Gravity.. These are all ShowStoppers..no?   There were a few moments I was really excited for a song and overall the show was done very well. But when you aren't familiar with a certain musical and they do three songs from it, you get sort of antsy. I hope that they can fine tune this show with audience feedback because I want it to survive."
i get sick and cant show up to work i feel so distressed now that i cant decide whether god wants me to pursue a masters or not i feel like an idiot because i dont see myself as successful

i was feeling indecisive again and didn t want to put complete strangers through the agony i put myself through before i make a large purchase i m not good at decision making so we walked around the area shops before returning to the hotel for our welcome reception
i feel like this week these photos are kind of boring and uninspiring
"Because of it's close proximity to my house, I decided to give it another try (with Groupon pricing.)  Went in shortly after they opened so I didn't have to wait long at all.  After having been to some other car washes, I've learned not to have high expectations.  My car was basically clean although the drivers side mirror and window were obviously neglected and left spotty.  Just don't expect excellent service.  Definitely wouldn't pay full price but with discount pricing it's okay."
i couldnt help feeling like this scene was going to come up in fond reminiscences years from now
i could almost be tempted to carry on doing photography only together as it worked so well but i feel that my aching back and nervous system will persuade me to remain as a retired wedding photographer
i want to know what it feels like to fall in love and never stop loving that person to have that love still live on after i am long gone
i discovered that someone is laughing at her while someone feel disgusted towards her
i allowed to feel a bit grumpy that she is years younger than me
i feel truly blessed to be on my own path
Truly a beautiful disc golf course on any day of the week. We came here from Texas and played the AMWorld Championships and it was a great time.
i was feeling jealous and i said no im not jealous because i know where i stand
i spent many years feeling resentful and angry that they didn t allow us to mourn him
i feel as though i need a topic to write about on here because i hate neglecting my beloved little blog
i cant relax and enjoy this relationship while i feel like i am constantly preparing to be paranoid about noah running off to fuck someone else
i also cannot be the guy waking up in the alley my ass feeling suspiciously tender and my wallet missing after following out what i thought to be a female and now remember finding out was a male right before being hit over the head with a lead pipe
i am growing in speaking my mind more in spanish through offering my feelings or opinions and i am not as afraid to talk to strangers or new people

i am progressing through the exercise steps and it feels sweet to realize i am now doing way more than i used to be able to
"I am impressed!   Thanks, once again, to Yelp!, we found great reviews here and decided to give this vet a try.  I confess, I was very demanding. I called to specifically get Dr. Koroknai to see my dog. I also contacted my previous vet to get the details (name, brand, code, dosage amount, and vaccination instructions) to relay to Dr. Koroknai's office.   They did not have the brand I wanted, or the single dosage (non-cocktail), so Dr. Koroknai went out of his way to order it! WOW! ***THUMBS UP!***  Still wary of vets, (due to one horrific previous experience - with a different vet), I had on my skeptical look the whole time, waiting to see what would happen next.   DR. KOROKNAI Dr. Koroknai inquired about her general health. Then he gave her a ""very general"" checkup, listening to her heart rate, took a look at her eyes, and weighed her. (My previous vet INCLUDED those PLUS looks at her teeth, her ears, and her anal area).   What impressed me was that Dr. Koroknai actually SHOWED me the packages of the  vaccination shots, just to prove he was indeed giving me what I had requested!  ***TWO THUMBS UP!***  Then, he explained WHY some dogs might get bad reactions from certain  vaccinations by explaining the process and ingredients used in these vaccinations! ***ONE PAW UP!***  Next, he gave my dog her vaccination shot, and asked me to wait 10-15 minutes after, just to see if there are any negative reactions. He explained what the typical non-threatening symptoms were (lethargy, soar spot, hot temperature or fever). But just to keep her cool and give her lots of water. I did not know about the latter. ***TWO PAWS UP!!!***  So far, my dog is acting normal and is laying on the balcony sun tanning. So I guess that means we'll be back here!   PRICE:  So unfair! Prices in Canada are 3 times MORE than the USA! What's up with that? Also, in the US, I would ONLY get charged for what my dog actually needed. Here, you have no choice. Any visit to see the vet INCLUDES a check-up fee, on TOP of services needed. (Meaning, you can not just come in for the vaccination). Lepto shots WITH check-up fee here are $59. Bummer. I called around, and apparently, that is just the way it is in the GTA.  TIP TO VET: Hopefully the new location @ 1012 Bathurst St. is newer, cleaner, and doesn't smell like dirty dogs baking sweets. (Seriously, it smelled like pets & muffins at the same time! Great way to kill your sweet tooth). But HOORAY for Dr. Koroknai!"
I was enjoying a lovely evening on my vacation during the NCECA Conference and me and a friend decided to go out and grab a drink. We stumbled upon this cute little place with a rooftop bar with a fun and trendy atmosphere. We were enjoying our drinks and we each had a few sips left when an employee walked by and prematurely swept our drinks away. I felt extremely disrespected as neither I or my friend were asked about the status on our drinks. Have fun but be cautious as you may find yourself blindsided just as I was. What once was a lovely evening on my last night in Pittsburgh is now a night were I feel cheated of a good time and a good brew.
"The hotel has a perfect location for a visit to UPMC or the University of Pittsburgh. It is a 20 minute walk from CMU.   The rooms are a bit run down and the entire hotel breeds 1990ties. It is not clear how much of an update is has reached since then. The beds are pretty good. The rooms have separate AC - the noisy types. The rooms facing the street are quite noisy so I hope you are immune to street noise. The is a gas station in front of the hotel.   The rooms have wired and wireless internet, but the service is a bit slow and has drop-outs.   Had breakfast at the mezzanine level. The food is ok but the service is really not great.   Great venue and OK rooms. This could be a killer place if they cared a little."
"I went here after waiting for a long errand. If you're going to go here I would not suggest the regular burger. It felt overpriced and too greasy for an ordinary cheeseburger especially in Vegas. For cheaper you can get a better version of this cheeseburger at In N Out and everything tastes less greasy and more fresh.   I'm not a fan of bacon burgers but the bacon burger my boyfriend got was way bigger and tastier than my burger and about the same price. The biggest strength of the entire bacon burger was the barbecue sauce. Definitely the right thickness and taste. Would highly recommend this if you come for a burger, as it beats Carl's Jr's western bacon burgers out of the water, as well as most other bbq bacon burgers I've recalled having.  Otherwise it was standard fair for fast food. On par with other fast food services.  The mozzarella sticks are fine too. They're on par with most mozzarella sticks from other places. The winner here is the fries. The fries are amazing.  I'm not sure if they were fried in animal fat but the oil they used definitely had some flavor to it. It's not as great as I would have hoped but I suspect my review would've been higher if I based it on the bacon burger I had and not my cheeseburger"
i love pairing pink and red as i find that although they feel strange to combine they compliment each other so well
i feel quite pleased and very peaceful surrounded by my books
i just think what they do at the bippity boppity boutique offers such a great opportunity and is worth the price just to make these two little girls feel so special and good about themselves
i feel more irritable my threshold to many things like crap talk lame jokes childish behaviour
i have to admit im feeling pretty overwhelmed
i didn t feel at all nervous about it
i feel like it may have taken away from the story somehow i would have liked to see them interact more
"I normally like Italian foods and restaurants, but I don't think I'll likely come back to this place again.   To begin, they don't really have any individual menus for you to view. Instead, they have a giant menu placed on the wall for EVERYONE to view. It was quite hard to see what was on it, especially when your table is far away.   Regarding the food, it is quite good. The servings come VERY large so it's acceptable to have at least a group of people when you come here."
"We've been to many Macayo's locations and are rarely disappointed, this was no different.  It's always good food but not great food.  We shared a cheese crisp and a shredded beef chimichanga.  The cheese crisp was good but a bit overpriced (almost $7) for a toasted tortilla with a THIN layer of cheese.  The chimicanga was good but was quite a bit smaller than I remember and was $12.  I don't mind paying for good food, and I don't have to be stuffed when I leave to be happy, but it does seem like the value could be adjusted a bit.  On a high note, I'm always happy when a Mexican restaurant carries a variety of Mexican beers.  Yay, Dos Equis lager on draught!!!!"
i feel like there isnt any dirty oil left on my skin after using this to clog my pores or make my skin oily towards the end of the day
im feeling less fearful anxious worried since returning though
i feel maybe its freaking selfish of me but i cant keep sobbing and sobbing and feeling sorry for myself
i feel rather selfish and spoiled for even using such a term but it is what it is
i hate feeling tortured by the thoughts in my head
"I love Greek food! Unfortunately, Paymon's is average or slightly below average in quality.   I stopped by for lunch around noon. There was a party of 12 in front of us, so it took the hostess about 5 minutes to greet or acknowledge us. Not too bad.  I ordered a pita gyro, Athens fries, falafel as an appetizer, coffee, and  baklava for dessert.   The good: Athens fries. Fresh hot and excellent seasoning.  Coffee. Very hot and smooth. Falafel. Two people in my party had never tried falafel, but really liked Paymon's take. Excellent.  The bad: The gyro. This was my main course and the worst part of my meal. The meat was heaping, but was cold and unappetizing. It must have been sitting a very long time before being served. I came here for a good gyro and was unhappy with the fare.  Do yourself a favor and drive a block away to Stephano's across the street from UNLV. The gyros at Stephano's are superior."
i thought about my own depression about the negative thoughts ive had lately and how i can intervene in those thoughts to help myself not feel so depressed
We went as a group of 4. Oma had Turkey club and fruit which she loved. My son had chicken and fries the chicken was mediocre and the fries were wonderful. They were out of crepes so my husband had to have pancakes Banana Foster instead of Crepes Banana Foster the pancakes were overcooked. I had the cinnamon roll French toast which was overcooked but tasted okay. The manager was super nice. The waitress was friendly but never came back to ask us for refills we had to ask someone to get us refills. At the end the manager gave us 15% off because of the issues with the overcooked food and the chicken that was not there only the breading.
i want to avoid feeling naughty
i still feel the gentle firmness of his fingers on my jaw the jaw revealing my stubborn will and i realize those same hands are the ones that worked the wood into beauty that touched the leper to make ugly skin beautiful that were pierced with nails to make my life beautiful
im left feeling nostalgic and lonely
i remember feeling so posed and terrified taking this picture
i love being able to publish online but sometimes i cant help but feel that ache and longing for handwritten things and pleasures of a simpler time
"Moksha Yoga Pickering is under the same management as Moksha Yoga Markham.  The studio since it is less than 1 year old, is spacious and nice decorated in a more pastel theme. The practice room is bright and sunny... with floor to ceiling windows on 2 sides... and it can be way too sunny especially for savasana!  There are 2 rooms one for heated and one for room temperature so they are able to offer a lot more varieties of classes!  The change room is nice with 3 individual showers and all the things you need and more...  The teachers that teaches at this location is similar to Markham location and even the class pass you can use that at both studios."
The difference between the $20/hr vs. $35/hr is u get more back massage time on the $35. I went for the $20/hr as I like the foot massage. The reason for 3 stars is that the lady I got didn't seem to know what she was doing but she did put in an awesome effort in trying...I would probably go again but I would hope to get someone different
i feel that at this point i should clarify that barcelona is not a dangerous city nor are you ever highly like to be mugged however if you are sampling the night life do be as cautious as you would anywhere else
i wonder if anyone is even looking at my materials but now im feeling reassured and energized
i feel that books are always a wonderful gift for a baby
i feel a little sympathetic
i promise if i leave your body will continue to feel this tortured agony as each one of my bites has marked you and sent a venom of sorts coursing through your body
i can think about is how lonely i feel im all grouchy and agitated and esily airritated
"This hotel was clean however it is so far from the strip. Every day my friends and I had to uuber back and forth to the strip and back. The location is just inconveniant and you absolutely will have to uuber or drive out about 15 minutes to get to the strip. The buffets at this hotel were decent. The food is okay if youre starving but there are much better buffets at other hotels. Other than the location and buffets, this place was a clean place to stay which matters most to me. The pool and hot tub were very big and nice and we had a great view of it from our room. If you dont care for being on the strip and want an affordable and clean place to stay, then south point is for you. But if you will be spending most of your time on the strip you are better off staying on the strip."
i feel so helpless while my parents struggle to feed my family
im feeling a little overwhelmed
i feel so caring and shit a href http sharonwhl
ive heard stories about julie baileys treatment before now but this is the first time i seen anything in print and it makes me feel deeply ashamed that someone who stood up neglected nhs patients and their families can become so isolated in her own community
i feel the suffering and i really feel the pain
i feel a bit suspicious of one of my co workers who i think might be grilling me a bit harder than she needs to
i feel really inadequate and i just wish i had enough brains to atleast pretend to know what i was doing
i feel loved liberated and forgiven
"The UNLV Dining Commons is a great place to socialize and enjoy some good food. In the past it was not very good, but ever since they hired a new food service company they have been working really hard to prepare dishes that are different daily, but still have the favorites. It is buffet style and their is always something for everyone.   I like this new and improved Dining Commons way better then the old. The staff is nice and the managers walk around to make sure everything runs smoothly. They are super nice as well."
i feel relieved with that thought
i feel honored and grateful to anyone who felt strongly enough about my service to vote for me
ill be darned if i will feel shamed for caring about the blogging community
"I have mixed thoughts about Rudy's. On the positive side, it's an awesome setup with very nice employees. I LOVED the cream corn and peach cobbler. This ribs and breakfast burrito were pretty good too. My husband loved the corn on cob and it looked delicious. I HATED the pulled pork. It was so bitter that neither my husband or I could eat it - it went straight into the trash. They smoke with White Oak, and the bitterness makes your toes curl. I also didn't care for the cole slaw, brownie or the banana pudding (pudding very bland).   Will I go to Rudy's again? Definitely yes. I will try to hone my selections until I get my favorite meal."
i feel less frantic
i feel kind of strange
"I came here with a friend on Reggae night (Sunday night) and it was a mediocre experience.   The drinks weren't very good but were priced cheaper than in old town. They came in plastic disposable cups instead of actual glasses. I found that different and interesting.  Only half of the club is used for Reggae Night so the place was small and although it got crowded by midnight, most people weren't dancing which was odd. By midnight anywhere in old town, people are dancing! I was very confused, especially since Reggae isn't hard to dance to.   The crowd was a bit older, maybe early thirties, some people were in their twenties. A lot of males, definitely disproportionate when it comes to the female to male ratio.   The service was 50/50, some people that worked there were very professional and helpful while others were not.   I liked the Reggae music, it was more modern than classic, but I didn't mind. They also played a lot of hip-hop, it was a mix, so not only reggae.   The bathrooms could use a little help, other than that the place was alright. The vibe was nice. They had a lot of strobe lights the whole time where as in old town strobe lights aren't used as much (more so at Smashboxx than anywhere else in old town). The smoke machine was working which I really like, you definitely don't see these types of effects in old town, again mostly at Smashboxx and sometimes at Maya or The Mint.   I asked someone who worked there what Friday and Saturday nights were like and he said the whole club is used unlike Sunday nights and it's packed, also on Fridays it's Latin night, and on Saturdays it's Hip-Hop night, so all in all he said those nights are better to visit."
i start feeling kind of weird
"Upstairs was closed on Monday, so wasn't able to check it out. Just let us walk up there at least, shouldn't be a big deal. Only had one happy hour drink, but got a Ble Moon for 3 bucks and staff was nice and even one patron was nice, offering me his leftovers of his HH food...I passed. The TV's at the bar were large and I enjoyed the baseball game at the bar before moving on to the next bar. I would not brave the weekend crowds though, unless your one of ""that"" crowd, but 5pm on  Monday was an excellent time to sample things out."
i hate to feel threatened totally
i must say it is a wonderful feeling and makes me feel so submissive
i will feel a cool breeze come over me like i did almost on a nightly basis in the hospital before you died
I need a coffee!   City Roast Coffee and Tea might not make an excellent Americano but it is just so conveniently located inside The West Side Market.   Price is reasonable priced $2 for a single shot Americano.  Lady was super friendly. The cup has built in sleeve so I can enjoy my hot beverage while walking around the Market.
i know some of you feel pressured to protect your families from this years tornado season but remember even if you purchase it and make the decision today it must be installed and your family still need to stock it and know under what conditions it should be used
"Sometimes the donuts are stale, even at 6am. They're usually good though. The coffee is good, but don't let them put cream and sugar in for you because the ratio is always off. The low-calorie breakfast sandwiches are pretty tasty."
i don t feel as much intimidated by it
i love them so much and i feel so loved by them
i would still feel frightened
i feel confused and lost
"I had the Grilled Mac + Chee which is macaroni, cheese, bacon and crispy onion on white.  Combo'd it to add a drink and a side of pasta salad for a total of $9.  My 12 year old had a simple gilled cheese with bacon and a bag chips. Overall the lunch was good- service was great!"

i felt it when a girl who was dear to me lied to my face i got angry with the fact that she knew i didnt believe her but she kept on telling lies
"I used to eat at the one in uptown pretty often because I used to work up there so when I found out that they were opening a matthews location, I was super excited. They are one of the few Mexican restaurants that we've been to out here in NC that actually has good salsa. My husband and I are born and raised from CA and were used to eating Mexican food at least 3 times a week. Most of the places out here have salsa that tastes like ketchup. I really like their al pastor tacos in the uptown location. Unfortunately, I don't feel like the matthews location is up to par with the uptown location. Both times I've been here the meat in my tacos have been cold. First time I got the fried fish taco, and two al pastor tacos and today I got a chicken, braised beef, and carnitas taco and they all had luke-warm/cold meat. I'm also not a huge fan of their rice, but that's not a big deal."
i caught myself feeling more irritated and sad
"Simple but good chinese food. Recommend sezchuan or hunan chicken dishes. However, very busy at peak meal times so plan wisely."
i was actually feeling somewhat listless and unmotivated earlier this afternoon but then i had a cup of coffee medium strength coffee at that and now im bursting at the seams
Line wrapped into the hallway by the restrooms. Was 1 hour line. Food was good but not worth the money at all. 50 bucks for 2 breakfast sandwiches and sodas is a bit much. Even in Vegas.
i will still feel homesick yes
ive been having breakdowns again ive been feeling depressed and for the three four days i was sticking to my old sleeping pattern i was feeling pretty great not the best but better than normal

"This place is bomb! The JR specialist my favorite. Sometimes is better than other days and sometimes it's different. It depends on whose cooking the food! It has it's pros and cons. But over all, the service is great. And the food is okay!"

"Located in South Park Mall, this Starbucks location is a good place to stop and grab a coffee while you're shopping. It's pretty tiny and there are only a couple seats, so it's not really a good place to hang out or meet someone. There are, however, a bunch of comfy seats just outside the Starbucks in the mall area. I've been more impressed with service at other locations. The tween employees were pretty wrapped up in their own gossiping here."
"The chips, salsa, and teas are good.   I havent had any alcoholic drinks there so I cant vouch. Ive been meaning to review this place for a while. Because everytime I go, I remember how unimpressive the food is, and I tell myself I wont return. And then I forget and return, and remember all over again. All the food kinda sorta tastes the same. I dont know how else to explain it. Once I got steak tacos (before I went veg) and they were chewy (in the bad way). Yekh. This time around, I got portobello tacos. Not seasoned well at all. Ive had tastier tofu.   And they apparently only season their rice one way. And that is not a good way.   I would return for chips, salsa, and to try their drinks, but I would skip the food. Nothing great about it."
i have always felt that but i also feel that perhaps it might be something like being a faithful teacher who shares a sense of social awareness and responsibility with the young or on the other hand i had dreams of being a public speaker me a public speaker
i can also feel quite a little uncertain when i stand or turn suddenly
i remember feeling restless a strange sense of detachment towards my birth place
im also feeling less frightened at going back to see my family for christmas
"Front desk attendant, Corinne, was unhelpful to say the least and EXTREMELY rude. She made our first few minutes in the hotel unpleasant and unwelcoming. We were then able to speak with Tricia who was helpful, polite, and able to clarify and fix the mess that Corinne had made with our reservation. Also, wifi is only free for two devices, even when paying for four people to stay at the hotel. Quite a rip off. We also paid for a bellagio fountain view and they had apparently overbooked them and we did not get it."
im kinda feeling mad
i am sure that many people would feel safer if the fbi were investigating more suspicious incidents

i must tell you i still sometimes feel cranky about this
i feel like i am alone in this world other days i feel like i am surrounded or being closed in on and just want to be alone
i am feeling very excited and i am no darn good at keeping things i am excited about to myself or because i am feeling that i need to just push forward and make myself tow the line which i will have to do if i start this ball rolling
The food was so so. Service was poor because they were short staffed. Not as cozy as their Leslie location.
i feel nervous but i feel eager

i feel weird to step out from home with my glass
"A friendly staff whom don't speak english...Casino dealers here can't count right, and/or are low quality break in dealers...This casino should be called ""The Cannery Nursing Home"" especially at the buffet where the food there is blah and the old timers are laying some nasty colon farts (stinky)...Movie theaters are ok, so is parking (except where the tractor trailers are taking up 10 spots to park sideways)..."
i can feel dazed by all those choices so much so i find myself standing still in front of that blank page unable to make a move
i asked the girls i was with if it was just me or if their eyes were feeling weird also
i feel like we ve hit the sweet spot
"Came here for lunch AYCE on a weekday.  Their menu doesn't have anything unique or special, pretty typical selection for AYCE sushi restaurant. Their nigiri were very fragile, with the rice part broke into two almost immediately after being picked up by chopstick. Their spicy salmon and salmon rose were much better and consistently made.  The service is very slow. I arrived before noon before lunch crowd came and it still took more than 70 mins in total. You'd better order everything in one order or else you have to be ready for extended lunch break. The waiters are generally friendly, but amount of sushi delivered were often less than what was ordered.  Overall, it's an okay AYCE sushi restaurant, one of many."
i feel like more americans should be outraged as i am yet most of us are blinded
"I want to really like this local spot but their sandwiches and prices relegate it to being a sort tourist trap in the kitschy part of Old Town Scottsdale.  Regardless, their soda options are something fun for the kids."
i feel that in a shots film x film every photo valuable
"I came here on Wednesday evening to have dinner at the recommendation of my hotel concierge. The restaurant itself is located in an old stable, so it's a really interesting venue. The restaurant is also located in old Montreal, a historic part of town with some really interesting architecture and old buildings. The service itself is quite nice, attentive, and responsive.  I ordered the ribeye, or what they referred to as the Gibbys cut, which was a standard 22oz steak. Being in Montreal, I wanted to try a steak with true Montreal seasoning, and it actually was much less salty than Montreal seasoning rub you would buy in a store, which I liked as most places tend to over salt their meat.  One thing to note is that their medium rare It's probably a little bit more rare than you would typically expect. Also, they only season one side of the meat which was a surprise to me. The cut of meat wasn't spectacular for a ribeye steak... it didn't taste that spectacular. The asparagus that came with the steak was also not season at all and tasted like it was simply blanched quickly.  When you order a steak it also comes with a side and a salad. The salad had a dressing mixed in which I asked for to be on the side but the salads were premade so the only thing the waitress could do was request a light dressing -- it was tasty but still a bit too heavy on the dressing for my taste.  The Monte Carlo potato is basically one where they scoop out the potato, mash it and add bacon bits, chives, etc, and stuff it back into the potato.    Menu price ~$54.  The ambience is nice, and you don't have to cook it yourself, but an average tasting ribeye, blanched asparagus, a salad, and a baked potato for that price just felt a bit too high."
i don t know why i feel so scared i feel it all the same i feel i want to be the one both feeling mad
Never again!  Food is excellent BUT it is not worth waiting an hour plus in line. The long wait is caused by the staff. They are sooooo slow in getting customers through the line.   Avoid this place unless you take a 2+ hour lunches.   Improve service and I will be back.
ive heard him have sex in the two years ive lived here and i always feel sympathetic and happy for him when it happens
i was pressing my hand too hard and diluting what lucy could feel tonight i was gentle as can be and for every movement kick we both looked straight at each other knowing that we had both felt it
"Service is great. Delivery is fast.  Delivery kids are nice. They charge a $1.00 for delivery, so that comes off their tip.  12 wings are $12.00.  They just started posting their prices online and I understand why. They are very expensive.  Been there since 2012 and just put their prices out there.  Pasquales has 20 wings for $15.99 and 10 wings for $7.99.  They are just as good.  I was very disappointed tonight. I got wings. They were crunchy because they were reheated in the microwave then covered in sauce and the zuchhini (cold) was supposed to be batter dipped like tempura, but seemed breaded.  In addition, there was no taste to them at all.  I probably wont order from them again as they smidge on the pizza sauce too.   Too bad though cuz they are so close."
i would definitely still go through that weird achy feeling all over again because i am really loving my smaller face now
i feel like i just did something naughty in the basement with my high school boyfriend
i also know if you do nothing you will come away feeling bitter and defeated

"I've been to La Tea several times, I'm ok with most of their drinks but they are just so overpriced. I don't think the drinks they sell deserve the price tag."

"I was hoping for so much for.  The Sonic burgers were ok, nothing special or tasty.  The fries were lukewarm unsalted and undesirable.  The onion rings were hot but very greasy and also undesirable.  I feel like it was a mediocre meal and if I go back it will only be for ice cream.  I can say the staff who brought our meal was very pleasant and friendly the reason that I gave them 3 stars."
i am feeling pretty homesick for maine

i feel furious and embarrassed and sluttish and blessed but it isn t enough that i m pregnant when men aren t supposed to get pregnant at all but the whole world is going to know that these babies have different fathers when they have one look
i know not all women feel this way but i have felt very unimportant int the church and almost dare i say second class citizen im not trying to bash the church but i think some women are so thirsty for knowlege about her to reinforce their own place and importance in the world
i feel terrible for having snapped at him
i feel offended for my friends in the fine art world
"I have to preface this by saying I love Starbucks! Love their drinks, food, merchandise, etc. we were so happy when this Starbucks opened, as its right by our church/school. The building is very pretty inside and out, and everything is working and available unlike the Starbucks on Eastern, south of this location. This alone gets three stars.  But let me now write about what gets ZERO stars. The customer service. For the first month or so, it was GREAT! Then, it was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Fast forward to last week. I got two vanilla frapachinos for my kids, one with caramel. I get this every time and have never had an issue. I pull up to the window, and I'm waiting, and waiting, and then the barista starts to make my drinks. I'm the only car in the drive-thru, so it's not busy.  As he's making them, I'm watching, and see that he makes them both without caramel. I stated caramel, and I was charged for caramel, but no biggie, it's a mistake! He eventually opens the window and starts to take my card. I say ""I'm sorry, I tried to get your attention to tell you, but one of those should have caramel."" He looks at me, slams my card on the counter, then rolls his eyes at me and sighs! REALLY??? He then slams the window shut, and angrily fixes the issue. Opens the window back up, gives me my drinks, my card, and no straws. He then realizes he didn't give me straws, hands then to me, and closes the window.  No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for the mix up"", nothing. Terrible customer service.  I tried to get his name, but we was wearing a blank name tag. So barista with the grating goatee, thanks for the less than stellar service! If I happen to be ""helped"" by you again, I'll make sure to get your name."
i wanna hold you like dancing no matter how much time has passed and keep dancing feeling your tender touch
i wasnt feeling so hot so i slowed up a little concentrating on just keeping my cadence up and my form good
"Recently relocated to Tucson, Arizona and there are no Filipino places around so we are constantly cooking it at home, boo hoo for us right? Any time we are in Phoenix however we stop in.  Sometimes you just want Mom's home cooking without having to work for it, and this place does the trick! Their tilapia tasted just like home, but I can't say the same for the adobo or pork menudo, in my pork menudo (respecting the fact that every Filipino has their own adjustments to this recipe, i.e. some use raisins some don't or some use achuete powder others not so much, you get it)...the ingredients however tasted old. Almost like they didn't sell it all and have been using the same batch reheated over and over.  The adobo tasted fine but there was also equal parts bone as there was meat in our served portion.   Sinigang was wonderful.   All in all the food was good and works for us when we have a hankering and happen to be in the city. But you know what they say, there is nothing like Mom's home cooking, no matter how hard you try!! :)"
i feel appreciative of food again and i am so thankful for that
i feel like she s judging me and he s not here and i don t want to seem like the needy girl so i don t know
i feel so vulnerable to criticism like if my lunch stinks or if somebody comments on what i eat i have this embarrassed feeling
i feel like they are not respected as they should be
"You know what they say about location, location, location?  Well this place is in a horrible location to say the very least.   I was extremely nervous to leave my car in the parking lot & while walking to the restaurant a bum rode up on his bicycle and asked us for money. Sketchy!  But we kept on because of the glowing reviews.  Also, there's a swingers club in the same strip mall....gives new meaning to strip mall. the inside decor of the restaurant leaves much to be desired as well. This is not a 'date place' in terms of dressing up.  Jeans are protocol here.  They also don't take reservations, which doesn't score any points with me.  Our waitress barely spoke English to the point where another one of the waiters had to assist with our table.  She also asked us if we liked cats????????????? Now when eating in an Asian restaurant we both thought this was extremely weird. Apparently, she had found a mother cat with babies and was trying to find them homes?????? At least that's what we hope.  Food was pretty good, I wouldn't' say it's the best Thai food I've ever had, Sakun Thai is closer to me and just as good.  I'm going to go back and try it again in case there's something I missed. Stay tuned."
i feel insulted that my loyalty to my faith is somehow tied to this belief system
"My name is kayla I recently used beauty studio Inc to assist with my hair and make up for my wedding in January. The stylist Danielle did a amazing job on my make up she was on time, and professional I'd definitely recommend Danielle. For your make up services, but not for hair not only did she burn my forehead on my wedding day but she didn't cover the burn. Your wedding day is sacred it should be treated as so not only did the manager Ember email me. To say I would be refunded on my hair services it was never done very unprofessional it's now a month later. To be a company that charges the rates they advertise, and the fact I paid to upgrade you'd think they would be more professional. Hope you all have better luck than I did in the future best regards."
i sit around and i feel disillusioned with school
i feel ashamed that i again let it come that far
i sit with that sit with a lifetime of an incredibly active and vital woman encompassed in three hours and someone who was a fully functioning human being now feeling with reason so afraid and so alone
i feel so unsure about what will come to be and what i will have to do
i wonder how many people are against my do it only when you feel like it perspective but i think if you do it for the sake of doing it without wanting to do it then it will turn out to be the result of crappy work
i feeling sympathetic for you
"My favourite thing about this Sushi chain restaurant is their selection of unique rolls. THey don't do the typical combo platters that most Sushi places feature, but have a very extensive list of rolls that have yet to let me down. Who knew Tuna, Salmon, and Avocado could make so many different dishes.  My measuring stick for a good sushi joint is always in the sashimi, and this place meets the mark. I've always really enjoyed it here and so that means everything else is decent.  They don't have the best hours, only open for lunch and then dinner, nothing in between, which I think is unfortunate.   The decor is pretty plain, run of the mill. Nothing fancy here at all.  The one thing I don't like is how close your'e sitting to the people next to you. They are honestly part of your conversation. Not my style!  For convenient yummy sushi, this place usually wins my vote."
"Vanity was suggested to me from a friend, she had picked up a great lotion here.  I was browsing the little boutique for a bit before a woman came out to the front and greeted me.  She asked if I had an appointment, I said no, I was just looking at their skin products.  She didn't offer any further help.  I was after their hemp lotion, but a small container of body butter was $22.  The other Suki lavender and lemongrass lotions they had were too strongly scented for me.  They had a gardeners soak that looked really appealing, but I don't ""soak"" often.  There were these really cute retro ice bags for $20, I had to have one!  There was a few more professional products as well.  They have a selection of make up, which was quite pricey.  I asked about getting the simple vanities package on the up coming weekend, but the lady said they were full.  Their packages go for $180 to $300.  Don't plan to just walk in here for services, the place isn't very big and it seems its best to book ahead.  Even though I haven't had services here, for the cost of things and the initial impression I got, there are other places I think I would rather go."
i help busy overworked mainly but not exclusively women go from feeling overwhelmed frustrated and generally pissed about their health and appearance

"I can report several comical and odd things here.  1- It is both a take-out and a dine-in restaurant, but everyone has to order at the cashier. I was taking out. 2- They only had one lone employee in the open kitchen area and he was also making kabobs for the staff. Guess where this story will go from here. 3- As mentioned, half their business is for take-out, but they have not bothered to put a sign or overhead menu at the cash. On your way to the cashier there is a poster for ""pizza."" Who in their right mind orders pizza... at a Lebanese restaurant? Well, maybe some people will .... 4- .... the kitchen had two baskets of French fries on the go! Who in their right mind goes to an Arabic restaurant and orders French fries?? Reminds me of the time I was dining with friends at Bombay Bhel and the food's options were a- with rice or b- with naan or c- with fries!! After laughing at the possibility of someone eating fries at an Indian restaurant the waiter served the table next to us... French fries... true story! Yuck! 5- Back to Paramount. It is a good chain and both the beef and chicken were pretty good for a chain. The prices were average as well. They have a whole section dedicated to sweets and cookies, which we always pass on. Regardless, it is there. I do have to say that the lady who wrapped and packaged the food was quite polite, smiling and deliberately made sure she asks my name and used it with a wide grin. So five stars for politeness and trying! Ample parking available in this plaza as well."
"Reason for Visit: Craving some fish noodle soup with some friends  Menu: I've been here for a few years now, and only thing that has been increasing is their price ($11.50 now per bowl). It is still in my opinion reasonable as they do give a lot of toppings, more than most other noodle joints like Dagu. I personally go for their parsley soup or black pepper as their original fish soup is a bit bland.  (note: if you want a cold drink it is an extra $1)  Service: You check off what you want then give to a waitress. Fast and efficient. No concerns.  Atmosphere: Average decorated. Lighting is a bit dim.   Overall: 3/5. It is what you pay for, not the best noodles out there, but you get what you paid for. This place is great if you want a quick decent meal."
i feel terrific and have so much energy now
i feel insulted you called me a software developer
i feel a little horny she brings you up and then you know you want it i like the way you give it girl your mouth is dry your heart is beating faster you wanna die but youre afraid to ask her she pops a gun your prayers already answered tick tock man thank you man
"Will keep this straight to the point.  Convenient location, clean lobby, and adecent selection.  I will use them for service, but as far as purchasing a car goes, I will get quotes from others before coming here(as everyone should shop around).  While everyone was friendly, the high pressure sales seemed almost like I was at a used car dealership.  The vehicle I wanted was a 2013 and its March of 2014, so I just went with the pressure.  Had I not needed this car at the amazing price advertised though, I would have put more effort into getting other quotes.  Worth a visit, but do your homework.  Don't plan on buying a car that same day, they will start budging hard when you're walking out the door.  Let them call you back."

"I've eaten here a few times, including my first visit to Vegas 5 years ago, and I think it's gone downhill a bit (maybe since Sheraton took over?).  Because I was staying in Planet Hollywood, and I'm lazy, I ate here for dinner and then again for breakfast.  At dinner, some of the food was pretty good, like the tandoori chicken, seafood enchiladas, and the barbecue ribs, but most of it was just ok.  The service was decent, but that changed the next day.  At breakfast, food again was mixed quality.  The tri-tip steak was delicious, potatoes were good, fruit was decent, most the other stuff (eggs, pastries etc.) was ok.  But the service was fucking awful; we waited about 10 minutes before our server took our order, and when I needed a refill it took a good 15 minutes before our server came by.  And when my friend asked him to replace her OJ because it was super watery, he gave us attitude and told us there was fresh-squeezed OJ at the buffet (which was not true).  He was a dick, and for maybe the first time ever i didn't leave a tip at all.  Spice Market used to regularly top the list of Vegas buffets, but either it's gone downhill or my expectations were too high.  It's still decent but I won't be back for awhile."

"Dates of stay: 6/23-6/25/18  My husband and I are Wyndham timeshare owners. Our properties were not available for the dates I needed so I booked via RCI Exchange and used our points. I'm unable to speak of the actual rate charged but the RCI fees were reasonable. I was charged a $100 refundable security deposit.  The property spans across Lindell. Unfortunately we checked in late so there were no non-smoking rooms available on the main property site. The front desk called for security to escort us to our room since we did not have a car. The response from the security via the walkie was unprofessional. We ended up walking to our room rather than waiting the 20 minutes he told the front desk. This meant we rolled our luggage with us right along Tropicana Ave. It was about a 5 minute walk so it wasn't too bad.  We were in room 2001A which meant we needed to access the floor from the elevator in the main lobby. Once you're off the elevator, there are two sets of doors: one leading to rooms and the other leading to another wing of the hotel, which is where we needed to go. I tried the door several times only to go back to the front desk and guided another route which meant taking the stairs.   We finally found our room and it was perfect for what we were looking for. There is a fridge w/ freezer, microwave, utensils, dishes, dishwashing soap, sponge, paper towels, shampoo & conditioner, soap, & hair dryer. Everything we needed was right there. The bed/pillows were comfortable. Although our room was close to Tropicana Ave / Lindell, we didn't hear any noises from outside. The only vending / ice machine is in the main lobby of building II near the breakfast dining area. We didn't get to visit the pool but I took a peek and it was smaller than your average resort pool. Keep in mind check-out is 10am. I was lucky the front desk called me at 9am to give me a courtesy reminder."
i hate feeling dumb i hate people who make me feel dumb or like i am being a baby
i feel grouchy at one point then it changes to a panic then to having this feeling like someone or something is after me
i alternate between feeling sympathetic toward humanity and being a misanthrope
im back and feeling very nostalgic
i have often observed that at times when it seems i should feel something im surprised by how disconnected i feel to the people and world around me
i feel greedy as if i have this great treasure inside of me and im stowing it away for myself to enjoy while i watch others suffer
i think we i can get caught up in the nature of being busy of feeling the need to fill each moment with industry of some sort of occupying blank spaces with effort and chores
i feel like real nut job because i m so freaked out over germs and not putting anything dangerous into my body
i always feel this way in these moods but it s still unpleasant
i have done that someone should feel offended
i usually tell her i m feeling pretty annoyed that she s butting in on my quiet time
i admit that with all the thoughts that go through my head i feel doubtful at times coz im scared
i had not realized was that to feel shaken at all i needed to unfreeze the box of grief that was casting a spell of numbness over me
i feel very lively but half the time i feel very groggy and irritated
i feel especially tortured
i shall have to stay feeling neglectful of all things art related
i feel that we learn from our mistakes and that we should not be afraid of trying something new
i am feeling particularly disheartened and unmotivated today
"Nightclub review only: Lines are usually long. Most times I have been there, there are promotors all over the place. Cover was $30 for guys. Drinks were around $15. They were mixed badly every time Ive been there. Dance floor is small in comparison to rest of the club. It was also very packed and hard to find people to dance with. Lots of tables and booth type areas all around the facility. Music played was mostly hip-hop/rap. Dancers were attractive. Despite it's shortcomings, I still managed to find people and have fun. The Downstairs lounge is a good place to hang out before or after for some real socializing."
"Ok, so the parking is cutthroat at times...but other than that, it's a decent little grocery store. It's close to the house, and their service is friendly enough. They have all the things I need, and I like that they are near a PetSmart."
i cry about feeling shitty i cry because dad made fun of me for being sick haha i kid you not that has happened many times all in good fun i cry because thats what i do in all adverse situations
i feel petrified with fear but i am uncertain as to what good it will do to bring up this secret that we seem to be hedging around
i remember wearing the dress feeling fabulous looking fabulous announcing my good news to many friends whilst wearing that dress
i feel on a women that she s extremely jealous i try to be very nice to her and giving her as many compliments as i can
Three of us came here recently after dinner plans at a nearby restaurant fell through.  We had the following:  Small plain hummus served with pita Small babaganoush with pita Side falafel Side gyro meat with pita bread Greek trio Γ  la carte Baklava Rice pudding  The hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.  The side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.  Both desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal.
i feel so overwhelmed by it that i feel it my overflow and begin to flow from my fingertips and and burst from beneath my skin
i feel as if i m generous
i feel like a blank canvas i have no clue what i am doing right now
i woke up too early in the morning feeling very paranoid uncomfortable and it took me a bit of time to settle down after a dream like that
i wonder me waking up and feeling a bit horny and trying it on with you
i keep feeling all paranoid that im going to gain weight but my size jeans are still fitting perfectly and my s fall off
i feel amazing doctor
i feel even more enraged
i know that my head feels lovely and i feel beautiful
i feel it may be bitter sweet at the end
im feeling kind of dumb admitting i was gloating over the fact that i had her now
i have always believed that love lives on that the feelings we have that are kind generous and accepting of others as they are exist independently of whether we decide to move on or not
i feel like i should be all ecstatic right now
im not feeling all loving
i feel and what i want to do so that i can break it to my parents in the most caring way that is least likely to get my ass kicked only verbally of course but i m really not sure that s better
i did not feel rushed or pressure to get back to training
im feeling artistic today
"We went this evening. Have been there so so many times, as they have a great Happy Hour! This evening, we asked for a table for 6, outside. We were told 15-20 minutes. After an hour, sitting around the fire place, seeing 6 tables (4 seat tables) open, I had to go back to the hostess and inquire. He said, no tables were available for 6, as he was sitting a table for 4. I asked why he could not put 2 tables together. He then agreed. We finally had a table, but no server. Thank goodness for our favorite waiter/bartender, Robert P. He asked if we were ok, and what he could do to help. As always, he was amazing. Saved the day. We will come back for the service of such. Thank you Robert!"
"I don't like the idea of a taxi picking me up from my residence and then taking me to the airport, since then they'd know exactly where I live and the fact that I'm going to be away from my home for a significant portion of time. Basically, I'm a paranoid person. And since my flights are regularly delayed, I hate relying on someone else to drop me off and then pick me up from the airport, especially when I don't know what time I'm actually landing. The resolution? Use the economy lot at LAS. The area seems relatively safe. I'm not sure if it's regularly security patrolled, but at least the shuttles are driving around the area often enough and keeping their eyes peeled. The charge is $10/day that can be paid by either cash or card upon exit. Do yourself a favor and remember the lot area you are at since the shuttle taking you to the airport will ask you and you know where to go to get your car later. It's always a good idea to take a photo of the lot area and the blurred # on the ground if you can. The shuttles come pretty frequently to take you to the airport, but they can fill-up and the shuttle drivers will not allow anyone to stand inside the shuttle. Have a couple of bucks handy to tip the driver, especially if they are loading luggage in the back for you. I haven't had an issue with luggage being taken by someone else, but again, I'm a paranoid person who puts a bunch of ridiculous things on their luggage to distinguish it from anyone else's luggage then peers out the window as people leave to make sure they didn't take my luggage. The only time I don't like parking out here is over the summer, when the sun is beaming down hard, so I'll make my way to regular and expensive covered parking ($14/day). During the holidays and other peak travelling times, spaces may be hard to come by, so prepare to drive towards the end of the lot to find vacancies."
i feel frantic but not
i wanted to tell him something to say it was great or shake his hands but he just stared at me still expressionless and i realized he s beyond all this beyond the world beyond me and my feelings and doubts and questions and petty concerns
i like naughty boys but i feel that naughty shld have its limits
i still feel a little dazed and have that sort of disbelieving feeling of oh my god
i should feel anything or think that minho s eyes have gotten rounder a little less handsome and a notch more vulnerable
i feel really listless right now
i am talking about feeling insecure

i am made to feel useless
i have nothing to feel especially bitchy about but still i am
"Ordered an old favorite, Italian chopped salad. It wasn't as good as I remembered it lettuce didn't seems as fresh and crunchy as it should. Loved the garbanzo beans and I added sliced avocado.  The dressing is still delicious though. I would order it again and ask them to please make sure the lettuce is fresh..."
i feel like its more dangerous because you could play for ever without getting bored
i believed it was true love and feel devastated i wanted to settle down and have the whole marriage and kids thing with him
i think im scared of feeling shy when they ask me about it x hai yai yai xd nvm i shall take a nap since the weather looks pretty good
i was feeling heartbroken this time it had nothing to do with a stupid boy who wasnt worth it
i can t justify i get a little annoyed when non diabetics say they have low blood sugar because i imagine their low blood sugars don t feel as terrible as mine do
Went here for the ice cream per a recommendation and I was disappointed. Small amount of ice cream for more $ than I expected. I'll have to try something different next time.
i feel like burton is a hugely talented writer but that this book just wasnt right for me
i hate the feeling that i am a pathetic loser that can do nothing right
i always feel a little naughty being at home on a week day sick or not sick past am and that naughty exciting feeling starts to dissipate around pm when i know people start to filter out of their offices and head home
i turn feeling ridiculously awkward and very self conscious to face zayne
"Don't forget Wednesday's are .99 hard shell shredded chicken taco nights. You wont see any advertising or p.o.p, but all locations in Vegas offer when asked."
i feel search engine marketing plays very important function for every internet website
Too bad this Wal-Mart is closed. The location was convenient for me. I liked their selection of food items. If you go in The morning it isn't too crowded. They always had all the items I needed. I also used the pharmacy here.
i be so rough and mean yet still manage to make kirihara feel so delicate
i am quite pleased to state that both feel very eager to get back to school after their well traveled summer vacation
i know that s wrong but i feel ugly
i just feel so cheated and lied to and resentful
"We visited here hoping for a 5 star experience.  We obviously gave it a 3.  With that said, the atmosphere and service were superb.  However, the  sommelier never even cracked a smile at us. The food was mediocre. We had the grilled octopus and fingerling potatoes (very good), the duck confit (crispy, but VERY SALTY), and the hangar steak and frites (just OK).  I feel that it was better that a lot of restaurants there on the strip, but it still was missing that je ne sais quoi.  Not one thing really wowed me, and you know that's what I'm looking for in Las Vegas."
i am feeling very bitter very saddened and very confused
i feel depressed moody and just lethargic and tired
im hopeful that judd will be able to assemble a cast he feels passionate about and that hell be able to tell some great stories
i am procrastinating and feeling overwhelmed
im feeling lousy i may dismiss a gorgeous day if im feeling bright and cheerful then the most dreary of days becomes tolerable
"This is an incredibly beautiful property, it is just huge.  It is built against a rocky hill and is surrounded by the golf course.  We stayed in one of the Casitas in the lower part of the property.  All day long starting at 5am there are buses, trucks and maintenance carts driving by.  The noise is deafening.  At no time during the day was it relaxing.  It also seems that they could cut there maintenance staff by at least 30%.  WHY do they need all those people that look like they are doing nothing except driving around being super loud!!  Now let's talk about how housekeeping yells to there fellow cleaners constantly throughout there cleaning effort, while one is downstairs the one upstairs is yelling for something, asking questions.  HEY!!  I am still in my room trying to sleep or work or rest!! SHUT UP!  Won't be back.  This is for conventions where the guests are gone all day or you are wasting your money."
i also want to feel god s love in a passionate way
i had to be transgender and this very brainwashing attempt is now making me feel so horrible as though im trying to deceive physicians here in germany into believing that i am intersex
i feel that the fa would not be supportive of this and would support the faw views on the matter
i am feeling very agitated and unquiet violence in movies does that to me and i just watched a zillion suicides and murders
im starting to feel hostile and aggravated
i feel the gentle push to walk away and i feel peace about it i know that its right
i feel like i am being obnoxious by posting every three seconds
im feeling socially pressured i can tell lou i need some anti social time
i feel really honoured because in the guitar world mr mclaughlin is a guitar god
i also feel less timid and comfortable with the world at large instead of my little sphere of people close to me
i can t enjoy reading the permaculture magazine anymore i just feel intimidated and left out
"Jaleo is a modern tapas style restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. Hip, sparse lighting, and a menu that i couldn't stop ordering from. It wasn't only because the food sounded so amazing but also because the portions were certainly small. It is tapas after all. Even so, anticipate spending a few $ and ordering a lot of plates to feed a large group.   Make sure you order a pitcher of Sangria! Best sangria i've had in a while. It's infused with watermelon, orange, basil, and other refreshing fruits.  My recommendations include: Lobster Paella Scallops Garlic Shrimp"
i feel shame on the dirty parties it should be a fair fight when we let foreign workers decide for our future and the international knows it sorry but malaysia will be like those third world countries soon
im feeling petty and mean right now so im going to say this
i feel greedy but it was my mom
i think we feel plenty useful we do more dishes and cook more meals and change more diapers than we ever have and we generally get in fewer bar fights and go on fewer destructive drunken benders
i think secretly he gets some sort of satisfaction knowing i havent gotten over him and feel tortured because i could never have him
"So, this is the spot that a lot of Asians like to go to while in Vegas..and the morning after...with a hangover.  Maybe just me.  But anyway.  Considering it's the only Pho place I have been to in Vegas, maybe I'm just too spoiled coming from SoCal where there's Pho places everywhere.  The broth had a different taste to it...and it was much heavier.. more msg?  The noodles weren't as soft (even after letting it soak in the broth for a while). The meat was okay, but there were pieces that did not look appealing.  The service was okay, they were nice.  They were very quick in seating 9 of us, but took forever in coming back to take our orders..We had to flag them down.  Also, they seemed a bit hasty in clearing our plates (maybe they were running low?).  It can be kinda awkward..especially when I'm still eating and they're trying to take my food away... Overall, it was okay."
i can eat but allow myself one naughty item of my choice to avoid feeling deprived
i instantly feel rejected
"Food was pretty good, although watch what you order ""Γ  la carte"". It will add up FAST!"
i am feeling passionate and alive in the present
i very well could have made this entry one that you dont have access to but i feel trusting today for no apparent reason
i love my marathon shirt but do feel kind of weird wearing it like im trying to brag or something
i feel like im still unsure if i want to stay here or not
i would always feel amazed at how impacted these and year olds were by this subject
i feel like saying in a completely obnoxious manner hello
i only want to write here when i am feeling unhappy
i knows is the boy makes her feel weird and yuuki doesnt know what to tell her
"So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was ""iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha"" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.  So I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.  So why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.  The coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!"
i love emily but i have a feeling she wouldnt keep my hostile feelings a secret especially when my parents invite their friends whom which i dont know or really want at my party
i am feeling foolish for taking lb to the e
i make to myself for the next weeks is to just meet the steps head on when i feel nervous or anxious and to remember that is a great achievement
i feel rather left out because im not fond of most of the front runners
ive been feeling very irritable lately
I was in the store for over a hour. Could have used some help but was never asked. Check out girl removed all items from hangers and stuffed into a bag. All had to be ironed before wearing.
i can go my own pace and not worry about feeling rushed because there are a lot of people
i am sorry if that sound too harsh i feel like the greedy grandson staring down at the death bed asking for the family home but i think the flag is on the field is that the right metaphor
i feel that friendly discussion about the problem can ease out the impact substantially
i feel like one savage
"As far as airport foods goes, nothing is great  ... however, the asiago bagel is definitely more of a hit here than a miss."
"Taco Tuesday drew me in to finally check this place out.  In order to get the $2 taco special on Tuesday, you must dine in, really?  I ended up eating in and you must get the chicken, pork, or shredded beef for $2, which I did, but the shredded beef comes with a strange cheese which I asked not to have.  The chips and salsa hit the table first and it was pretty good, though the salsa was a little different.  The tacos came out soon after and were decent, nothing special.  I would say that the flavor of pork was a little better than the others, but again nothing special."
i feel intimidated by the whole thing right now just learning the ropes in this field but see the awesome potencial for earnings and eduation to all in the fitness and health field thanks for you real honesty and intelligence when sharing
i feel i could have been more supportive if i knew what you and dr
i met someone who makes me feel so treasured real and wanted

i am feeling relatively mellow this sunday morning
ive been feeling kinda irritable lately too and normally im not really like that
I had the special of the evening. It was a pepperoni pizza grilled cheese sandwich. The only problem is that it arrived cold. The server took care of everything for me.
i have lately been feeling very irritated amp tired
i feel that it is important to compartmentalize my data programs users etc into different partitions as a result of this so that some will be encryption protected while others will not so as to benefit from better performance as a result of not being encrypted
i remember last summer feeling so overwhelmed
"The franchise owner reached out to me and gave me a store credit for my next visit. My fiance and I went today after work since he hasn't had it in a few months. We ordered to go again since we had errands to run after we ate. I explained to the store manager (a different one than I spoke to on the phone) and showed her the messages, let and she was very accommodating and polite. This time around they made sure to tell me that they cannot ensure fully gluten free as they don't have enough room to have a gluten free fryer. I am fine with that as long as they take precautions.  My fiance loved his meal and had 5 mild flats, while I had 5 honey bbq drumsticks. I ate the first one with no problem, but when I got to the second one I had a problem. I found a feather still attached to the wing. I called up the store to let her know and she was very apologetic. I actually had to laugh at my luck. I told her that I still didn't want free things and she told me that the cooks sort through the wings to try to catch those problems, but sometimes they slip through. I assured her it wasn't a problem and I just thought she should know. I ate every wing besides that one which seemed to pretty much fill me up.   While I can't give this location 100% yet due to the issues I've had back to back, I feel as though 3 stars is a whole lot better than 1.   I will be giving them another try in a few months to try my luck again."
I think the pool and locker rooms could be better maintained.  The pool looks like it has a bathtub ring.  I find it expensive for seniors who are not on Silver Sneakers programs.  We encourage our elderly to stay active yet make it cost prohibitive for them to join. $45 for a one person senior membership is too high.
"Posh was definitely a unique experience but it's not for everyone. We went for a birthday celebration and had a blast. I was the pickiest of our group but the chef did a great job at accommodating me. My entire group really enjoyed the experience but thought the food wasn't worth the money. We had a near $500 bill for 4 of us (and one of the group did not have any alcohol) and when it was all said and done, we agreed that it would have been better spent elsewhere. The element if surprise was nice throughout the meal though!"
i imagine and feel love for each thing in my day going well before i do it
i feel like a martyr it is usually because i am being unkind to myself and not doing what i love
i feel hostile like shit
i know scones are not a must have food but i am determined to live a frugal lifestyle without feeling deprived
Very nice interior and a second floor with lots of tables for larger parties and they allow for card games etc. I don't really like their bubble tead or other drinks find the one nearby like cha time and go for tea better. But on a night with friends definitely a good spot to hang out and have a good selection of hot and cold drinks as well as different desserts and cakes.
i know its not real but i still feel shaken
"Went there on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend, took about an hour from arrival to receive the food. We got the vegetarian plate (vegan) to share, it was great. Huge portions, we were super full and couldn't finish the plate (even though I tried). Super cheap. We were in love. Service was OK.  Went another time with 2 other people, we planned to share one plate since it was a friend's first time and we weren't that hungry. 3 different people took our order within the our between our arrival and after being seated. We were then approached by an older woman who said we had to order another plate since there's 3 of us. I told her we'd already placed the order 3 times and had been waiting there for over an hour and no one mentioned anything. She then left and sent over a younger woman, with dyed light brown hair maybe about 45-50 years old, who was extremely rude and told us we had to order another plate or leave. There was another table of 5 sharing two plates. We pointed it out and she said ""they are paying taxes (???)"". We asked why no one had mentioned anything since we had ordered and waited so long and she said ""If you don't wanna wait why don't you leave? Leave then."" So we left.   3 stars because the food is delicious and dirt cheap and I will be back even though the service is atrocious."
i feel listless but today was aiiiiighhhht
i see a westerner and a local happily chatting to each other in mandarin and i feel rather rude that i m unable to do the same after being here for so long
i feel more satisfied so the new diet wins this round
"Walking in, I noticed it was totally remodeled and it looks really nice. It's been a few years since I have been in the location. The host stand greeted us and were polite.  Walking to our table i noticed the floors were really dirty (food and trash not picked up) and after we sat I saw the menus had crud on them. For it being as dead as it was, it took a while for our server to come ask for our drink order (which she was absent most the evening). We ordered a basket of potato wedges (which is supposed to come loaded with sour cream and green onion) and we added bacon. We got a basket with potatoes and bacon. I ordered a side of sour cream and they yummy once again! The chili queso was yummy as always but the chips were SOOOOO salty.. our wings were pretty good. My hubs got boneless mango habanero and sweet bbq (the bbq ones were a bit dry and hubs didn't like them too much) and I got  the traditional (flats only) at medium. Mine were pretty good I just have an issue with broken bones. To end the night we got the cheesecake bites which are always delish!  Not a big fan of coming here anymore. I dunno. I like some things I just feel as if they need to work customer service and food quality."
i walked alone towards china sweating with the trepidation one feels when going to meet a beloved that one has not seen for a long time
i used to enjoy feeling delicate and gentle now i feel hard heavy and brutish
im feeling invigorated again and not a moment too soon
"The dinner service was quite good and the staff were polite and friendly. For service I would give 5 stars. The ambience was good, though before remodeling last year, my opinion is that it was better. The food was not what I was hoping for. The samosas lacked flavor and the shell was rather thick for a samosa. The tandoori paratha was very good. The main dish I ordered, malai kofta, was a big disappointment. I did order mild assuming this meant minimal hot chilis not expecting little or no spices in the malai kofta and the sauce as well. The sauce tasted too tomato like. It looked like a mixture of sour cream and canned tomato pieces with some food coloring. The pistachio kulfi was passable. It was too green in color. Because it was served in a martini glass, it was a little hard to cut a piece with a spoon when trying to eat it without tipping over the glass. Overall, the food was below average. The only reason why I might give it another try some day is that the service and ambience made it a good dining experience."
i kissed her forehead feeling its warmth and giving her a sympathetic look as she stared up at me with big tear filled eyes
i have talked about it too much i feel here is a video if you are curious
i can make you feel very anxious with panic attacks or very depressed
i was telling her about how i was feeling a bit homesick
i feel kind of alone and helpless in
i had someone ask me once why my life is so much about the business and my response is that i feel everything with life and work and my artistic practice is so intertwined and that one feeds the other
i felt as if i was fighting a battle that i was never going to win and i just didnt feel strong enough to attempt to fight it anymore
im happy with my race pace officially and my ability to pull it together when i started feeling crappy
i feel very deprived i feel like i did so many things right amp so many things just went wrong

"I work close by, so I have their food at least once a week if not twice. I have tried several dishes and they are above the other Asian take-out but not great. The waitresses are always quick, helpful and with a smile. My issue has been with the older Asian women. I find her rude on the phone and in person. I went to have lunch last week. I ordered my side of ginger dressing as usual. I can tell it puts her out to have me use that in place of a brown sauce. However, I pay for it. I call today to place my usual order. She tells me she can't do that and that dressing is only for salad. First of all, who the fuck are you to tell me what condiment to pair with which dish.  Secondly, I stated on the phone you brought this to me in person. The women lies and says this didn't happen.Lastly, you are a rude person who should not be head of house dealing with paying public. I have wanted to slap you so many times. I will never give my money to your establishment. Stop taking the waitresses tips!"
i lost a very dear friend in the maschke family who now wants nothing to do with me because they feel that i am unsavory or mean or cruel
I'd love to give this place 5 stars. The operation is great and clean and I love the fact they use local ingredients and the flavor pairings are amazing. I just wish they'd use a different oil. The leaf lard imparts flavor to the donuts that takes away from the amazing flavor combinations.
i can feel the damage in aching joints headaches backaches etc
im feeling scared to take on something so new and so challenging
i feel so infuriated with it
ive sat there and wondered why a guy i liked hasnt texted me calling is not really my thing it makes me feel too awkward or why when he seems all efforts to the contrary he wont take a chance on me as his girlfriend
i tried to explain what my lyme and coinfections feel like i guess i could say it is a horrible painful nightmare that just won t end
i feel particularly ecstatic
when i flew from athens to copenhagen after a holiday the plane was caught in a storm and it began to shake and i thouhght that we were going to crash

i feel shaky still typing is super tedious and i will be damned if this is the one morning my nephew wasnt up for work at the crack of dawn
i can feel everything you do so be gentle not awkward and dont enter like a mack truck
i feel uncomfortable about this but you were here the day aiden disciplined spyke right
i tried to convince him to stay but he said that he feel tortured
i just wanted to feel beloved at that moment
"After a day of shopping in very hot weather, I needed somewhere to cool off, get a cold drink, a light snack, and watch some sports. I had nothing at home, so Buffalo Wild Wings was the closest place that checked all the boxes.  The place is very spacious, with lots of TVs showing just about every sport being broadcast at the moment.  An order of Chili Queso Dip, and a tall glass of Pepsi provided a tasty snack and the time I needed to cool off. The tortilla chips were crispy and the dip had layers of cheese, chili, and pico de gallo. It was good.  It wasn't very busy so my server, the bartender, was very attentive. The washroom was also very clean."
i personally feel amazed that i have managed to connect with such amazingly talented and creative people through this little world of dance
i feel intimidated by the great women in my family tree
